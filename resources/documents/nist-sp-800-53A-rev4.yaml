title: 'Assessing Security and Privacy Controls in Federal Information Systems and
  Organizations: Building Effective Assessment Plans'
alt-titles:
- A341This publication provides a set of procedures for conducting assessments of
  security controls and privacy controls employed within federal information systems
  and organizations. The assessment procedures, executed at various phases of the
  system development life cycle, are consistent with the security and privacy controls
  in NIST Special Publication 800-53, Revision 4. The procedures are customizable
  and can be easily tailored to provide organizations with the needed flexibility
  to conduct security control assessments and privacy control assessments that support
  organizational risk management processes and that are aligned with the stated risk
  tolerance of the organization. Information on building effective security assessment
  plans and privacy assessment plans is also provided along with guidance on analyzing
  assessment results.
