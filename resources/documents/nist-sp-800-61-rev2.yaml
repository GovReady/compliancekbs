title: Computer Security Incident Handling Guide
alt-titles:
- Computer security incident response has become an important component of information
  technology (IT) programs. Because performing incident response effectively is a
  complex undertaking, establishing a successful incident response capability requires
  substantial planning and resources. This publication assists organizations in establishing
  computer security incident response capabilities and handling incidents efficiently
  and effectively. This publication provides guidelines for incident handling, particularly
  for analyzing incident-related data and determining the appropriate response to
  each incident. The guidelines can be followed independently of particular hardware
  platforms, operating systems, protocols, or applications.
