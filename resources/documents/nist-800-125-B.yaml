title: Secure Virtual Network Configuration for Virtual Machine (VM) Protection
alt-titles:
- Virtual machines (VMs) are key resources to be protected since they are the compute
  engines hosting mission-critical applications. Since VMs are end nodes of a virtual
  network, the configuration of the virtual network is an important element in the
  security of the VMs and their hosted applications. The virtual network configuration
  areas discussed in this document are network segmentation, network path redundancy,
  traffic control using firewalls, and VM traffic monitoring. This document analyzes
  the configuration options under these areas and presents a corresponding set of
  recommendations for secure virtual network configuration for VM protection.
