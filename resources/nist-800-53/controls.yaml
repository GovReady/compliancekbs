supplemental-guidance: This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures
  for the effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements
  in the AC family. Policy and procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive
  Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidance. Security program
  policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for system-specific
  policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general
  information security policy for organizations or conversely, can be represented
  by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The
  procedures can be established for the security program in general and for particular
  information systems, if needed. The organizational risk management strategy is a
  key factor in establishing policy and procedures.

  when individuals are removed from the group.
family: ACCESS CONTROL
supplemental-guidance: 'Information system account types include, for example, individual,
  shared, group, system, guest/anonymous, emergency, developer/manufacturer/vendor,
  temporary, and service. Some of the account management requirements listed above
  can be implemented by organizational information systems. The identification of
  authorized users of the information system and the specification of access privileges
  reflects the requirements in other security controls in the security plan. Users
  requiring administrative privileges on information system accounts receive additional
  scrutiny by appropriate organizational personnel (e.g., system owner, mission/business
  owner, or chief information security officer) responsible for approving such accounts
  and privileged access. Organizations may choose to define access privileges or other
  attributes by account, by type of account, or a combination of both. Other attributes
  required for authorizing access include, for example, restrictions on time-of-day,
  day-of-week, and point-of-origin. In defining other account attributes, organizations
  consider system-related requirements (e.g., scheduled maintenance, system upgrades)
  and mission/business requirements, (e.g., time zone differences, customer requirements,
  remote access to support travel requirements). Failure to consider these factors
  could affect information system availability. Temporary and emergency accounts are
  accounts intended for short-term use. Organizations establish temporary accounts
  as a part of normal account activation procedures when there is a need for short-term
  accounts without the demand for immediacy in account activation. Organizations establish
  emergency accounts in response to crisis situations and with the need for rapid
  account activation. Therefore, emergency account activation may bypass normal account
  authorization processes. Emergency and temporary accounts are not to be confused
  with infrequently used accounts (e.g., local logon accounts used for special tasks
  defined by organizations or when network resources are unavailable). Such accounts
  remain available and are not subject to automatic disabling or removal dates. Conditions
  for disabling or deactivating accounts include, for example: (i) when shared/group,
  emergency, or temporary accounts are no longer required; or (ii) when individuals
  are transferred or terminated. Some types of information system accounts may require
  specialized training.'

short-title: AC-4
description: 'The information system enforces approved authorizations for controlling
  the flow of information within the system and between interconnected systems based
  on [Assignment: organization-defined information flow control policies].'
family: ACCESS CONTROL
supplemental-guidance: >-
  Information flow control regulates where information is allowed to travel within
  an information system and between information systems (as opposed to who is allowed
  to access the information) and without explicit regard to subsequent accesses to
  that information. Flow control restrictions include, for example, keeping export-controlled
  information from being transmitted in the clear to the Internet, blocking outside
  traffic that claims to be from within the organization, restricting web requests
  to the Internet that are not from the internal web proxy server, and limiting information
  transfers between organizations based on data structures and content. Transferring
  information between information systems representing different security domains
  with different security policies introduces risk that such transfers violate one
  or more domain security policies. In such situations, information owners/stewards
  provide guidance at designated policy enforcement points between interconnected
  systems. Organizations consider mandating specific architectural solutions when
  required to enforce specific security policies. Enforcement includes, for example:
  (i) prohibiting information transfers between interconnected systems (i.e., allowing
  access only); (ii) employing hardware mechanisms to enforce one-way information
  flows; and (iii) implementing trustworthy regrading mechanisms to reassign security
  attributes and security labels.

  Organizations commonly employ information flow control policies and enforcement
  mechanisms to control the flow of information between designated sources and destinations
  (e.g., networks, individuals, and devices) within information systems and between
  interconnected systems. Flow control is based on the characteristics of the information
  and/or the information path. Enforcement occurs, for example, in boundary protection
  devices (e.g., gateways, routers, guards, encrypted tunnels, firewalls) that employ
  rule sets or establish configuration settings that restrict information system services,
  provide a packet-filtering capability based on header information, or message-filtering
  capability based on message content (e.g., implementing key word searches or using
  document characteristics). Organizations also consider the trustworthiness of filtering/inspection
  mechanisms (i.e., hardware, firmware, and software components) that are critical
  to information flow enforcement. Control enhancements 3 through 22 primarily address
  cross-domain solution needs which focus on more advanced filtering techniques, in-depth
  analysis, and stronger flow enforcement mechanisms implemented in cross-domain products,
  for example, high-assurance guards. Such capabilities are generally not available
  in commercial off-the-shelf information technology products.

  Such user sessions can be terminated (and thus terminate user access) without terminating
  network sessions. Session termination terminates all processes associated with a
  user�s logical session except those processes that are specifically created by the
  user (i.e., session owner) to continue after the session is terminated. Conditions
  or trigger events requiring automatic session termination can include, for example,
  organization-defined periods of user inactivity, targeted responses to certain types

family: ACCESS CONTROL
supplemental-guidance: >-
  Information is represented internally within information systems using abstractions
  known as data structures. Internal data structures can represent different types
  of entities, both active and passive. Active entities, also known as subjects, are
  typically associated with individuals, devices, or processes acting on behalf of
  individuals. Passive entities, also known as objects, are typically associated with
  data structures such as records, buffers, tables, files, inter-process pipes, and
  communications ports. Security attributes, a form of metadata, are abstractions
  representing the basic properties or characteristics of active and passive entities
  with respect to safeguarding information. These attributes may be associated with
  active entities (i.e., subjects) that have the potential to send or receive information,
  to cause information to flow among objects, or to change the information system
  state. These attributes may also be associated with passive entities (i.e., objects)
  that contain or receive information. The association of security attributes to subjects
  and objects is referred to as binding and is typically inclusive of setting the
  attribute value and the attribute type. Security attributes when bound to data/information,
  enables the enforcement of information security policies for access control and
  information flow control, either through organizational processes or information
  system functions or mechanisms. The content or assigned values of security attributes
  can directly affect the ability of individuals to access organizational information.

  Organizations can define the types of attributes needed for selected information
  systems to support missions/business functions. There is potentially a wide range
  of values that can be assigned to any given security attribute. Release markings
  could include, for example, US only, NATO, or NOFORN (not releasable to foreign
  nationals). By specifying permitted attribute ranges and values, organizations can
  ensure that the security attribute values are meaningful and relevant. The term
  security labeling refers to the association of security attributes with subjects
  and objects represented by internal data structures within organizational information
  systems, to enable information system-based enforcement of information security
  policies. Security labels include, for example, access authorizations, data life
  cycle protection (i.e., encryption and data expiration), nationality, affiliation
  as contractor, and classification of information in accordance with legal and compliance
  requirements. The term security marking refers to the association of security attributes
  with objects in a human-readable form, to enable organizational process-based enforcement
  of information security policies. The AC-16 base control represents the requirement
  for user-based attribute association (marking). The enhancements to AC-16 represent
  additional requirements including information system-based attribute association
  (labeling). Types of attributes include, for example, classification level for objects
  and clearance (access authorization) level for subjects. An example of a value for
  both of these attribute types is Top Secret.

family: ACCESS CONTROL
supplemental-guidance: Remote access is access to organizational information systems
  by users (or processes acting on behalf of users) communicating through external
  networks (e.g., the Internet). Remote access methods include, for example, dial-up,
  broadband, and wireless. Organizations often employ encrypted virtual private networks
  (VPNs) to enhance confidentiality and integrity over remote connections. The use
  of encrypted VPNs does not make the access non-remote; however, the use of VPNs,
  when adequately provisioned with appropriate security controls (e.g., employing
  appropriate encryption techniques for confidentiality and integrity protection)
  may provide sufficient assurance to the organization that it can effectively treat
  such connections as internal networks.  Still, VPN connections traverse external
  networks, and the encrypted VPN does not enhance the availability of remote connections.
  Also, VPNs with encrypted tunnels can affect the organizational capability to adequately
  monitor network communications traffic for malicious code. Remote access controls
  apply to information systems other than public web servers or systems designed for
  public access. This control addresses authorization prior to allowing remote access
  without specifying the formats for such authorization. While organizations may use
  interconnection security agreements to authorize remote access connections, such
  agreements are not required by this control. Enforcing access restrictions for remote
  connections is addressed in AC-3.

family: ACCESS CONTROL
supplemental-guidance: 'A mobile device is a computing device that: (i) has a small
  form factor such that it can easily be carried by a single individual; (ii) is designed
  to operate without a physical connection (e.g., wirelessly transmit or receive information);
  (iii) possesses local, non-removable or removable data storage; and (iv) includes

  capabilities, on-board sensors that allow the device to capture information, and/or
  built-in features for synchronizing local data with remote locations. Examples include
  smart phones, E-readers, and tablets. Mobile devices are typically associated with
  a single individual and the device is usually in close proximity to the individual;
  however, the degree of proximity can vary depending upon on the form factor and
  size of the device. The processing, storage, and transmission capability of the
  mobile device may be comparable to or merely a subset of desktop systems, depending
  upon the nature and intended purpose of the device. Due to the large variety of
  mobile devices with different technical characteristics and capabilities, organizational
  restrictions may vary for the different classes/types of such devices. Usage restrictions
  and specific implementation guidance for mobile devices include, for example, configuration
  management, device identification and authentication, implementation of mandatory
  protective software (e.g., malicious code detection, firewall), scanning devices
  for malicious code, updating virus protection software, scanning for critical software
  updates and patches, conducting primary operating system (and possibly other resident
  software) integrity checks, and disabling unnecessary hardware (e.g., wireless,
  infrared). Organizations are cautioned that the need to provide adequate security
  for mobile devices goes beyond the requirements in this control. Many safeguards
  and countermeasures for mobile devices are reflected in other security controls
  in the catalog allocated in the initial control baselines as starting points for
  the development of security plans and overlays using the tailoring process. There
  may also be some degree of overlap in the requirements articulated by the security
  controls within the different families of controls. AC-20 addresses mobile devices

short-title: AC-20
description: >-
  The organization establishes terms and conditions, consistent with any trust relationships
  established with other organizations owning, operating, and/or maintaining external
  information systems, allowing authorized individuals to:

  a. Access the information system from external information systems; and

  b. Process, store, or transmit organization-controlled information using external
  information systems.
family: ACCESS CONTROL
supplemental-guidance: >-
  External information systems are information systems or components of information
  systems that are outside of the authorization boundary established by organizations
  and for which organizations typically have no direct supervision and authority over
  the application of required security controls or the assessment of control effectiveness.
  External information systems include, for example: (i) personally owned information
  systems/devices (e.g., notebook computers, smart phones, tablets, personal digital
  assistants); (ii) privately owned computing and communications devices resident
  in commercial or public facilities (e.g., hotels, train stations, convention centers,
  shopping malls, or airports); (iii) information systems owned or controlled by nonfederal
  governmental organizations; and (iv) federal information systems that are not owned
  by, operated by, or under the direct supervision and authority of organizations.
  This control also addresses the use of external information systems for the processing,
  storage, or transmission of organizational information, including, for example,
  accessing cloud services (e.g., infrastructure as a service, platform as a service,
  or software as a service) from organizational information systems.

  For some external information systems (i.e., information systems operated by other
  federal agencies, including organizations subordinate to those agencies), the trust
  relationships that have been established between those organizations and the originating
  organization may be such, that no explicit terms and conditions are required. Information
  systems within these organizations would not be considered external. These situations
  occur when, for example, there are pre-existing sharing/trust agreements (either
  implicit or explicit) established between federal agencies or organizations subordinate
  to those agencies, or when such trust agreements are specified by applicable laws,
  Executive Orders, directives, or policies. Authorized individuals include, for example,
  organizational personnel, contractors, or other individuals with authorized access
  to organizational information systems and over which organizations have the authority
  to impose rules of behavior with regard to system access. Restrictions that organizations
  impose on authorized individuals need not be uniform, as those restrictions may
  vary depending upon the trust relationships between organizations. Therefore, organizations
  may choose to impose different security restrictions on contractors than on state,
  local, or tribal governments.

  This control does not apply to the use of external information systems to access
  public interfaces to organizational information systems (e.g., individuals accessing
  federal information through www.usa.gov). Organizations establish terms and conditions
  for the use of external information systems in accordance with organizational security
  policies and procedures. Terms and conditions address as a minimum: types of applications
  that can be accessed on organizational information systems from external information
  systems; and the highest security category of information that can be processed,
  stored, or transmitted on external information systems. If terms and conditions
  with the owners of external information systems cannot be established, organizations
  may impose restrictions on organizational personnel using those external systems.

supplemental-guidance: Access control decisions (also known as authorization decisions)
  occur when authorization information is applied to specific accesses. In contrast,
  access enforcement occurs when information systems enforce access control decisions.
  While it is very common to have access control decisions and access enforcement
  implemented by the same entity, it is not required and it is not always an optimal
  implementation choice. For some architectures and distributed information systems,
  different entities may perform access control decisions and access enforcement.

  organization-defined access control policies] that is tamperproof, always invoked,
  and small enough to be subject to analysis and testing, the completeness of which
  can be assured.'
family: ACCESS CONTROL
supplemental-guidance: Information is represented internally within information systems
  using abstractions known as data structures. Internal data structures can represent
  different types of entities, both active and passive. Active entities, also known
  as subjects, are typically associated with individuals, devices, or processes acting
  on behalf of individuals. Passive entities, also known as objects, are typically
  associated with data structures such as records, buffers, tables, files, inter-process
  pipes, and communications ports. Reference monitors typically enforce mandatory
  access control policies�a type of access control that restricts access to objects
  based on the identity of subjects or groups to which the subjects belong. The access
  controls are mandatory because subjects with certain privileges (i.e., access permissions)
  are restricted from passing those privileges on to any other subjects, either directly
  or indirectly�that is, the information system strictly enforces the access control
  policy based on the rule set established by the policy. The tamperproof property
  of the reference monitor prevents adversaries from compromising the functioning
  of the mechanism. The always invoked property prevents adversaries from bypassing
  the mechanism and hence violating the security policy. The smallness property helps
  to ensure the completeness in the analysis and testing of the mechanism to detect
  weaknesses or deficiencies (i.e., latent flaws) that would prevent the enforcement
  of the security policy.

family: AUDIT AND ACCOUNTABILITY
supplemental-guidance: An event is any observable occurrence in an organizational
  information system. Organizations identify audit events as those events which are
  significant and relevant to the security of information systems and the environments
  in which those systems operate in order to meet specific and ongoing audit needs.
  Audit events can include, for example, password changes, failed logons, or failed
  accesses related to information systems, administrative privilege usage, PIV credential
  usage, or third-party credential usage. In determining the set of auditable events,
  organizations consider the auditing appropriate for each of the security controls
  to be implemented. To balance auditing requirements with other information system
  needs, this control also requires identifying that subset of auditable events that
  are audited at a given point in time. For example, organizations may determine that
  information systems must have the capability to log every file access both successful
  and unsuccessful, but not activate that capability except for specific circumstances
  due to the potential burden on system performance. Auditing requirements, including
  the need for auditable events, may be referenced in other security controls and
  control enhancements. Organizations also include auditable events that are required
  by applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations,
  and standards. Audit records can be generated at various levels of abstraction,
  including at the packet level as information traverses the network. Selecting the
  appropriate level of abstraction is a critical aspect of an audit capability and
  can facilitate the identification of root causes to problems. Organizations consider
  in the definition of auditable events, the auditing necessary to cover related events
  such as the steps in distributed, transaction-based processes (e.g., processes that
  are distributed across multiple organizations) and actions that occur in service-oriented
  architectures.

family: SECURITY ASSESSMENT AND AUTHORIZATION
supplemental-guidance: >-
  Organizations assess security controls in organizational information systems and
  the environments in which those systems operate as part of: (i) initial and ongoing
  security authorizations; (ii) FISMA annual assessments; (iii) continuous monitoring;
  and (iv) system development life cycle activities. Security assessments: (i) ensure
  that information security is built into organizational information systems; (ii)
  identify weaknesses and deficiencies early in the development process; (iii) provide
  essential information needed to make risk-based decisions as part of security authorization
  processes; and (iv) ensure compliance to vulnerability mitigation procedures. Assessments
  are conducted on the implemented security controls from Appendix F (main catalog)
  and Appendix G (Program Management controls) as documented in System Security Plans
  and Information Security Program Plans. Organizations can use other types of assessment
  activities such as vulnerability scanning and system monitoring to maintain the
  security posture of information systems during the entire life cycle. Security assessment
  reports document assessment results in sufficient detail as deemed necessary by
  organizations, to determine the accuracy and completeness of the reports and whether
  the security controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing
  the desired outcome with respect to meeting security requirements. The FISMA requirement
  for assessing security controls at least annually does not require additional assessment
  activities to those activities already in place in organizational security authorization
  processes. Security assessment results are provided to the individuals or roles
  appropriate for the types of assessments being conducted. For example, assessments
  conducted in support of security authorization decisions are provided to authorizing
  officials or authorizing official designated representatives.

  To satisfy annual assessment requirements, organizations can use assessment results
  from the following sources: (i) initial or ongoing information system authorizations;
  (ii) continuous monitoring; or (iii)   system development life cycle activities.
  Organizations ensure that security assessment results are current, relevant to the
  determination of security control effectiveness, and obtained with the appropriate
  level of assessor independence. Existing security control assessment results can
  be reused to the extent that the results are still valid and can also be supplemented
  with additional assessments as needed. Subsequent to initial authorizations and
  in accordance with OMB policy, organizations assess security controls during continuous
  monitoring. Organizations establish the frequency for ongoing security control assessments
  in accordance with organizational continuous monitoring strategies. Information
  Assurance Vulnerability Alerts provide useful examples of vulnerability mitigation
  procedures. External audits (e.g., audits by external entities such as regulatory
  agencies) are outside the scope of this control.

family: SECURITY ASSESSMENT AND AUTHORIZATION
supplemental-guidance: This control applies to dedicated connections between information
  systems (i.e., system interconnections) and does not apply to transitory, user-controlled
  connections such as email and website browsing. Organizations carefully consider
  the risks that may be introduced when information systems are connected to other
  systems with different security requirements and security controls, both within
  organizations and external to organizations. Authorizing officials determine the
  risk associated with information system connections and the appropriate controls
  employed. If interconnecting systems have the same authorizing official, organizations
  do not need to develop Interconnection Security Agreements. Instead, organizations
  can describe the interface characteristics between those interconnecting systems
  in their respective security plans. If interconnecting systems have different authorizing
  officials within the same organization, organizations can either develop Interconnection
  Security Agreements or describe the interface characteristics between systems in
  the security plans for the respective systems. Organizations may also incorporate
  Interconnection Security Agreement information into formal contracts, especially
  for interconnections established between federal agencies and nonfederal (i.e.,
  private sector) organizations. Risk considerations also include information systems
  sharing the same networks. For certain technologies (e.g., space, unmanned aerial
  vehicles, and medical devices), there may be specialized connections in place during
  preoperational testing. Such connections may require Interconnection Security Agreements
  and be subject to additional security controls.

  before commencing operations; and

  c. Updates the security authorization [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].
family: SECURITY ASSESSMENT AND AUTHORIZATION
supplemental-guidance: Security authorizations are official management decisions,
  conveyed through authorization decision documents, by senior organizational officials
  or executives (i.e., authorizing officials) to authorize operation of information
  systems and to explicitly accept the risk to organizational operations and assets,
  individuals, other organizations, and the Nation based on the implementation of
  agreed-upon security controls. Authorizing officials provide budgetary oversight
  for organizational information systems or assume responsibility for the mission/business
  operations supported by those systems. The security authorization process is an
  inherently federal responsibility and therefore, authorizing officials must be federal
  employees. Through the security authorization process, authorizing officials assume
  responsibility and are accountable for security risks associated with the operation
  and use of organizational information systems. Accordingly, authorizing officials
  are in positions with levels of authority commensurate with understanding and accepting
  such information security-related risks. OMB policy requires that organizations
  conduct ongoing authorizations of information systems by implementing continuous
  monitoring programs. Continuous monitoring programs can satisfy three-year reauthorization
  requirements, so separate reauthorization processes are not necessary. Through the
  employment of comprehensive continuous monitoring processes, critical information
  contained in authorization packages (i.e., security plans, security assessment reports,
  and plans of action and milestones) is updated on an ongoing basis, providing authorizing
  officials and information system owners with an up-to-date status of the security
  state of organizational information systems and environments of operation.  To reduce
  the administrative cost of security reauthorization, authorizing officials use the
  results of continuous monitoring processes to the maximum extent possible as the
  basis for rendering reauthorization decisions.

  g. Reporting the security status of organization and the information system to [Assignment:
  organization-defined personnel or roles] [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].
family: SECURITY ASSESSMENT AND AUTHORIZATION
supplemental-guidance: Continuous monitoring programs facilitate ongoing awareness
  of threats, vulnerabilities, and information security to support organizational
  risk management decisions. The terms continuous and ongoing imply that organizations
  assess/analyze security controls and information security-related risks at a frequency
  sufficient to support organizational risk-based decisions. The results of continuous
  monitoring programs generate appropriate risk response actions by organizations.
  Continuous monitoring programs also allow organizations to maintain the security
  authorizations of information systems and common controls over time in highly dynamic
  environments of operation with changing mission/business needs, threats, vulnerabilities,
  and technologies. Having access to security-related information on a continuing
  basis through reports/dashboards gives organizational officials the capability to
  make more effective and timely risk management decisions, including ongoing security
  authorization decisions. Automation supports more frequent updates to security authorization
  packages, hardware/software/firmware inventories, and other system information.
  Effectiveness is further enhanced when continuous monitoring outputs are formatted
  to provide information that is specific, measurable, actionable, relevant, and timely.
  Continuous monitoring activities are scaled in accordance with the security categories
  of information systems.

  that could be exploited by adversaries. Such testing can be used to either validate
  vulnerabilities or determine the degree of resistance organizational information
  systems have to adversaries within a set of specified constraints (e.g., time, resources,

  also use the results of vulnerability analyses to support penetration testing activities.
  Penetration testing can be conducted on the hardware, software, or firmware components
  of an information system and can exercise both physical and technical security controls.
  A standard method for penetration testing includes, for example: (i) pretest analysis
  based on full knowledge of the target system; (ii) pretest identification of potential
  vulnerabilities based on pretest analysis; and (iii) testing designed to determine

  guides) provide recognized, standardized, and established benchmarks that stipulate
  secure configuration settings for specific information technology platforms/products
  and instructions for configuring those information system components to meet operational
  requirements. Common secure configurations can be developed by a variety of organizations
  including, for example, information technology product developers, manufacturers,
  vendors, consortia, academia, industry, federal agencies, and other organizations
  in the public and private sectors. Common secure configurations include the United
  States Government Configuration Baseline (USGCB) which affects the implementation
  of CM-6 and other controls such as AC-19 and CM-7. The Security Content Automation
  Protocol (SCAP) and the defined standards within the protocol (e.g., Common Configuration
  Enumeration) provide an effective method to uniquely identify, track, and control
  configuration settings. OMB establishes federal policy on configuration requirements
  for federal information systems.

  The organization:

  a. Configures the information system to provide only essential capabilities; and

  b. Prohibits or restricts the use of the following functions, ports, protocols,
  and/or services: [Assignment: organization-defined prohibited or restricted functions,
  ports, protocols, and/or services].
family: CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT
supplemental-guidance: Information systems can provide a wide variety of functions
  and services. Some of the functions and services, provided by default, may not be
  necessary to support essential organizational operations (e.g., key missions, functions).
  Additionally, it is sometimes convenient to provide multiple services from single
  information system components, but doing so increases risk over limiting the services
  provided by any one component. Where feasible, organizations limit component functionality
  to a single function per device (e.g., email servers or web servers, but not both).
  Organizations review functions and services provided by information systems or individual
  components of information systems, to determine which functions and services are
  candidates for elimination (e.g., Voice Over Internet Protocol, Instant Messaging,
  auto-execute, and file sharing). Organizations consider disabling unused or unnecessary
  physical and logical ports/protocols (e.g., Universal Serial Bus, File Transfer
  Protocol, and Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) on information systems to prevent unauthorized
  connection of devices, unauthorized transfer of information, or unauthorized tunneling.
  Organizations can utilize network scanning tools, intrusion detection and prevention
  systems, and end-point protections such as firewalls and host-based intrusion detection
  systems to identify and prevent the use of prohibited functions, ports, protocols,
  and services.

  d. Protects the configuration management plan from unauthorized disclosure and modification.
family: CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT
supplemental-guidance: Configuration management plans satisfy the requirements in
  configuration management policies while being tailored to individual information
  systems. Such plans define detailed processes and procedures for how configuration
  management is used to support system development life cycle activities at the information
  system level. Configuration management plans are typically developed during the
  development/acquisition phase of the system development life cycle. The plans describe
  how to move changes through change management processes, how to update configuration
  settings and baselines, how to maintain information system component inventories,
  how to control development, test, and operational environments, and how to develop,
  release, and update key documents. Organizations can employ templates to help ensure
  consistent and timely development and implementation of configuration management
  plans. Such templates can represent a master configuration management plan for the
  organization at large with subsets of the plan implemented on a system by system
  basis. Configuration management approval processes include designation of key management
  stakeholders responsible for reviewing and approving proposed changes to information
  systems, and personnel that conduct security impact analyses prior to the implementation
  of changes to the systems. Configuration items are the information system items
  (hardware, software, firmware, and documentation) to be configuration-managed. As
  information systems continue through the system development life cycle, new configuration
  items may be identified and some existing configuration items may no longer need
  to be under configuration control.

  and

  g. Protects the contingency plan from unauthorized disclosure and modification.
family: CONTINGENCY PLANNING
supplemental-guidance: Contingency planning for information systems is part of an
  overall organizational program for achieving continuity of operations for mission/business
  functions. Contingency planning addresses both information system restoration and
  implementation of alternative mission/business processes when systems are compromised.
  The effectiveness of contingency planning is maximized by considering such planning
  throughout the phases of the system development life cycle. Performing contingency
  planning on hardware, software, and firmware development can be an effective means
  of achieving information system resiliency. Contingency plans reflect the degree
  of restoration required for organizational information systems since not all systems
  may need to fully recover to achieve the level of continuity of operations desired.  Information
  system recovery objectives reflect applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives,
  policies, standards, regulations, and guidelines. In addition to information system
  availability, contingency plans also address other security-related events resulting
  in a reduction in mission and/or business effectiveness, such as malicious attacks
  compromising the confidentiality or integrity of information systems. Actions addressed
  in contingency plans include, for example, orderly/graceful degradation, information
  system shutdown, fallback to a manual mode, alternate information flows, and operating
  in modes reserved for when systems are under attack. By closely coordinating contingency
  planning with incident handling activities, organizations can ensure that the necessary
  contingency planning activities are in place and activated in the event of a security
  incident.

  authentication, or some combination thereof. Access to organizational information
  systems is defined as either local access or network access. Local access is any
  access to organizational information systems by users (or processes acting on behalf

  from the perspective of protecting the confidentiality and integrity of information
  traversing the network.

  Organizations can satisfy the identification and authentication requirements in
  this control by complying with the requirements in Homeland Security Presidential
  Directive 12 consistent with the specific organizational implementation plans. Multifactor
  authentication requires the use of two or more different factors to achieve authentication.
  The factors are defined as: (i) something you know (e.g., password, personal identification
  number [PIN]); (ii) something you have (e.g., cryptographic identification device,
  token); or (iii) something you are (e.g., biometric). Multifactor solutions that
  require devices separate from information systems gaining access include, for example,
  hardware tokens providing time-based or challenge-response authenticators and smart
  cards such as the U.S. Government Personal Identity Verification card and the DoD
  common access card. In addition to identifying and authenticating users at the information
  system level (i.e., at logon), organizations also employ identification and authentication
  mechanisms at the application level, when necessary, to provide increased information
  security. Identification and authentication requirements for other than organizational
  users are described in IA-8.

family: IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION
supplemental-guidance: Organizational devices requiring unique device-to-device identification
  and authentication may be defined by type, by device, or by a combination of type/device.
  Information systems typically use either shared known information (e.g., Media Access
  Control [MAC] or Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol [TCP/IP] addresses)
  for device identification or organizational authentication solutions (e.g., IEEE
  802.1x and Extensible Authentication Protocol [EAP], Radius server with EAP-Transport
  Layer Security [TLS] authentication, Kerberos) to identify/authenticate devices
  on local and/or wide area networks. Organizations determine the required strength
  of authentication mechanisms by the security categories of information systems.
  Because of the challenges of applying this control on large scale, organizations
  are encouraged to only apply the control to those limited number (and type) of devices
  that truly need to support this capability.

  The organization manages information system identifiers by:

  a. Receiving authorization from [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles]
  to assign an individual, group, role, or device identifier;

  b. Selecting an identifier that identifies an individual, group, role, or device;

  c. Assigning the identifier to the intended individual, group, role, or device;

  d. Preventing reuse of identifiers for [Assignment: organization-defined time period];
  and

  e. Disabling the identifier after [Assignment: organization-defined time period

family: IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION
supplemental-guidance: Common device identifiers include, for example, media access
  control (MAC), Internet protocol (IP) addresses, or device-unique token identifiers.
  Management of individual identifiers is not applicable to shared information system
  accounts (e.g., guest and anonymous accounts). Typically, individual identifiers
  are the user names of the information system accounts assigned to those individuals.
  In such instances, the account management activities of AC-2 use account names provided
  by IA-4. This control also addresses individual identifiers not necessarily associated
  with information system accounts (e.g., identifiers used in physical security control
  databases accessed by badge reader systems for access to information systems). Preventing
  reuse of identifiers implies preventing the assignment of previously used individual,
  group, role, or device identifiers to different individuals, groups, roles, or devices.

  The organization manages information system authenticators by:

  a. Verifying, as part of the initial authenticator distribution, the identity of
  the individual, group, role, or device receiving the authenticator;

  b. Establishing initial authenticator content for authenticators defined by the
  organization;

  c. Ensuring that authenticators have sufficient strength of mechanism for their
  intended use;

  d. Establishing and implementing administrative procedures for initial authenticator
  distribution, for lost/compromised or damaged authenticators, and for revoking authenticators;

  e. Changing default content of authenticators prior to information system installation;

  f. Establishing minimum and maximum lifetime restrictions and reuse conditions for
  authenticators;

  g. Changing/refreshing authenticators [Assignment: organization-defined time period
  by authenticator type];

  h. Protecting authenticator content from unauthorized disclosure and modification;

  i. Requiring individuals to take, and having devices implement, specific security
  safeguards to protect authenticators; and

  j. Changing authenticators for group/role accounts when membership to those accounts
  changes.
family: IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION
supplemental-guidance: Individual authenticators include, for example, passwords,
  tokens, biometrics, PKI certificates, and key cards. Initial authenticator content
  is the actual content (e.g., the initial password) as opposed to requirements about
  authenticator content (e.g., minimum password length). In many cases, developers
  ship information system components with factory default authentication credentials
  to allow for initial installation and configuration. Default authentication credentials
  are often well known, easily discoverable, and present a significant security risk.
  The requirement to protect individual authenticators may be implemented via control
  PL-4 or PS-6 for authenticators in the possession of individuals and by controls
  AC-3, AC-6, and SC-28 for authenticators stored within organizational information
  systems (e.g., passwords stored in hashed or encrypted formats, files containing
  encrypted or hashed passwords accessible with administrator privileges). Information
  systems support individual authenticator management by organization-defined settings
  and restrictions for various authenticator characteristics including, for example,
  minimum password length, password composition, validation time window for time synchronous
  one-time tokens, and number of allowed rejections during the verification stage
  of biometric authentication. Specific actions that can be taken to safeguard authenticators
  include, for example, maintaining possession of individual authenticators, not loaning
  or sharing individual authenticators with others, and reporting lost, stolen, or
  compromised authenticators immediately. Authenticator management includes issuing
  and revoking, when no longer needed, authenticators for temporary access such as
  that required for remote maintenance. Device authenticators include, for example,
  certificates and passwords.

supplemental-guidance: The feedback from information systems does not provide information
  that would allow unauthorized individuals to compromise authentication mechanisms.
  For some types of information systems or system components, for example, desktops/notebooks

  may be significant. For other types of systems or components, for example, mobile
  devices with 2-4 inch screens, this threat may be less significant, and may need
  to be balanced against the increased likelihood of typographic input errors due
  to the small keyboards. Therefore, the means for obscuring the authenticator feedback
  is selected accordingly. Obscuring the feedback of authentication information includes,
  for example, displaying asterisks when users type passwords into input devices,
  or displaying feedback for a very limited time before fully obscuring it.

supplemental-guidance: Adversaries may compromise individual authentication mechanisms
  and subsequently attempt to impersonate legitimate users. This situation can potentially
  occur with any authentication mechanisms employed by organizations. To address this
  threat, organizations may employ specific techniques/mechanisms and establish protocols
  to assess suspicious behavior (e.g., individuals accessing information that they
  do not typically access as part of their normal duties, roles, or responsibilities,
  accessing greater quantities of information than the individuals would routinely
  access, or attempting to access information from suspicious network addresses).
  In these situations when certain preestablished conditions or triggers occur, organizations
  can require selected individuals to provide additional authentication information.
  Another potential use for adaptive identification and authentication is to increase
  the strength of mechanism based on the number and/or types of records being accessed.

family: INCIDENT RESPONSE
supplemental-guidance: Information spillage refers to instances where either classified

  not authorized to process such information. Such information spills often occur
  when information that is initially thought to be of lower sensitivity is transmitted
  to an information system and then is subsequently determined to be of higher sensitivity.
  At that point, corrective action is required. The nature of the organizational response
  is generally based upon the degree of sensitivity of the spilled information (e.g.,
  security category or classification level), the security capabilities of the information
  system, the specific nature of contaminated storage media, and the access authorizations
  (e.g., security clearances) of individuals with authorized access to the contaminated
  system. The methods used to communicate information about the spill after the fact
  do not involve methods directly associated with the actual spill to minimize the
  risk of further spreading the contamination before such contamination is isolated

  developers, implementers, and operators, to leverage the team knowledge of the threat
  in order to implement defensive measures that will enable organizations to deter
  intrusions more effectively. Moreover, it promotes the rapid detection of intrusions,
  development of appropriate mitigations, and the deployment of effective defensive
  measures. For example, when an intrusion is detected, the integrated security analysis
  team can rapidly develop an appropriate response for operators to implement, correlate
  the new incident with information on past intrusions, and augment ongoing intelligence
  development. This enables the team to identify adversary TTPs that are linked to
  the operations tempo or to specific missions/business functions, and to define responsive
  actions in a way that does not disrupt the mission/business operations. Ideally,
  information security analysis teams are distributed within organizations to make
  the capability more resilient.

  (e.g., the Internet) or an internal network. Local maintenance and diagnostic activities
  are those activities carried out by individuals physically present at the information
  system or information system component and not communicating across a network connection.
  Authentication techniques used in the establishment of nonlocal maintenance and
  diagnostic sessions reflect the network access requirements in IA-2. Typically,
  strong authentication requires authenticators that are resistant to replay attacks
  and employ multifactor authentication. Strong authenticators include, for example,
  PKI where certificates are stored on a token protected by a password, passphrase,
  or biometric. Enforcing requirements in MA-4 is accomplished in part by other controls.

  for example, paper and microfilm. This control also applies to mobile devices with
  information storage capability (e.g., smart phones, tablets, E-readers), that are
  transported outside of controlled areas. Controlled areas are areas or spaces for
  which organizations provide sufficient physical and/or procedural safeguards to
  meet the requirements established for protecting information and/or information
  systems.

  Physical and technical safeguards for media are commensurate with the security category
  or classification of the information residing on the media. Safeguards to protect
  media during transport include, for example, locked containers and cryptography.
  Cryptographic mechanisms can provide confidentiality and integrity protections depending
  upon the mechanisms used. Activities associated with transport include the actual
  transport as well as those activities such as releasing media for transport and
  ensuring that media enters the appropriate transport processes. For the actual transport,
  authorized transport and courier personnel may include individuals from outside
  the organization (e.g., U.S. Postal Service or a commercial transport or delivery
  service). Maintaining accountability of media during transport includes, for example,
  restricting transport activities to authorized personnel, and tracking and/or obtaining
  explicit records of transport activities as the media moves through the transportation
  system to prevent and detect loss, destruction, or tampering. Organizations establish
  documentation requirements for activities associated with the transport of information
  system media in accordance with organizational assessments of risk to include the
  flexibility to define different record-keeping methods for the different types of
  media transport as part of an overall system of transport-related records.

  digital and non-digital, subject to disposal or reuse, whether or not the media
  is considered removable. Examples include media found in scanners, copiers, printers,
  notebook computers, workstations, network components, and mobile devices. The sanitization
  process removes information from the media such that the information cannot be retrieved
  or reconstructed. Sanitization techniques, including clearing, purging, cryptographic
  erase, and destruction, prevent the disclosure of information to unauthorized individuals
  when such media is reused or released for disposal. Organizations determine the
  appropriate sanitization methods recognizing that destruction is sometimes necessary
  when other methods cannot be applied to media requiring sanitization. Organizations
  use discretion on the employment of approved sanitization techniques and procedures
  for media containing information deemed to be in the public domain or publicly releasable,
  or deemed to have no adverse impact on organizations or individuals if released
  for reuse or disposal. Sanitization of non-digital media includes, for example,
  removing a classified appendix from an otherwise unclassified document, or redacting
  selected sections or words from a document by obscuring the redacted sections/words
  in a manner equivalent in effectiveness to removing them from the document. NSA
  standards and policies control the sanitization process for media containing classified

  In contrast to MP-2, which restricts user access to media, this control restricts
  the use of certain types of media on information systems, for example, restricting/prohibiting
  the use of flash drives or external hard disk drives. Organizations can employ technical
  and nontechnical safeguards (e.g., policies, procedures, rules of behavior) to restrict
  the use of information system media. Organizations may restrict the use of portable
  storage devices, for example, by using physical cages on workstations to prohibit
  access to certain external ports, or disabling/removing the ability to insert, read
  or write to such devices. Organizations may also limit the use of portable storage
  devices to only approved devices including, for example, devices provided by the
  organization, devices provided by other approved organizations, and devices that
  are not personally owned. Finally, organizations may restrict the use of portable
  storage devices based on the type of device, for example, prohibiting the use of
  writeable, portable storage devices, and implementing this restriction by disabling
  or removing the capability to write to such devices.

  e. Protects the security plan from unauthorized disclosure and modification.
family: PLANNING
supplemental-guidance: >-
  Security plans relate security requirements to a set of security controls and control
  enhancements. Security plans also describe, at a high level, how the security controls
  and control enhancements meet those security requirements, but do not provide detailed,
  technical descriptions of the specific design or implementation of the controls/enhancements.
  Security plans contain sufficient information (including the specification of parameter
  values for assignment and selection statements either explicitly or by reference)
  to enable a design and implementation that is unambiguously compliant with the intent
  of the plans and subsequent determinations of risk to organizational operations
  and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation if the plan is implemented
  as intended. Organizations can also apply tailoring guidance to the security control
  baselines in Appendix D and CNSS Instruction 1253 to develop overlays for community-wide
  use or to address specialized requirements, technologies, or missions/environments
  of operation (e.g., DoD-tactical, Federal Public Key Infrastructure, or Federal
  Identity, Credential, and Access Management, space operations). Appendix I provides
  guidance on developing overlays.

  Security plans need not be single documents; the plans can be a collection of various
  documents including documents that already exist. Effective security plans make
  extensive use of references to policies, procedures, and additional documents (e.g.,
  design and implementation specifications) where more detailed information can be
  obtained. This reduces the documentation requirements associated with security programs
  and maintains security-related information in other established management/operational
  areas related to enterprise architecture, system development life cycle, systems
  engineering, and acquisition. For example, security plans do not contain detailed
  contingency plan or incident response plan information but instead provide explicitly
  or by reference, sufficient information to define what needs to be accomplished
  by those plans.

  federal information systems, is often not feasible given the large number of such
  users and the limited nature of their interactions with the systems. Rules of behavior
  for both organizational and non-organizational users can also be established in
  AC-8, System Use Notification. PL-4 b. (the signed acknowledgment portion of this
  control) may be satisfied by the security awareness training and role-based security
  training programs conducted by organizations if such training includes rules of

family: PLANNING
supplemental-guidance: >-
  This control addresses actions taken by organizations in the design and development
  of information systems. The information security architecture at the individual
  information system level is consistent with and complements the more global, organization-wide
  information security architecture described in PM-7 that is integral to and developed
  as part of the enterprise architecture. The information security architecture includes
  an architectural description, the placement/allocation of security functionality
  (including security controls), security-related information for external interfaces,
  information being exchanged across the interfaces, and the protection mechanisms
  associated with each interface. In addition, the security architecture can include
  other important security-related information, for example, user roles and access
  privileges assigned to each role, unique security requirements, the types of information
  processed, stored, and transmitted by the information system, restoration priorities
  of information and information system services, and any other specific protection
  needs.

  In today�s modern architecture, it is becoming less common for organizations to
  control all information resources. There are going to be key dependencies on external
  information services and service providers. Describing such dependencies in the
  information security architecture is important to developing a comprehensive mission/business
  protection strategy. Establishing, developing, documenting, and maintaining under
  configuration control, a baseline configuration for organizational information systems
  is critical to implementing and maintaining an effective information security architecture.
  The development of the information security architecture is coordinated with the
  Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer (CPO) to ensure
  that security controls needed to support privacy requirements are identified and
  effectively implemented. PL-8 is primarily directed at organizations (i.e., internally
  focused) to help ensure that organizations develop an information security architecture
  for the information system, and that the security architecture is integrated with
  or tightly coupled to the enterprise architecture through the organization-wide
  information security architecture. In contrast, SA-17 is primarily directed at external
  information technology product/system developers and integrators (although SA-17
  could be used internally within organizations for in-house system development).
  SA-17, which is complementary to PL-8, is selected when organizations outsource
  the development of information systems or information system components to external
  entities, and there is a need to demonstrate/show consistency with the organization�s
  enterprise architecture and information security architecture.

family: RISK ASSESSMENT
supplemental-guidance: >-
  Clearly defined authorization boundaries are a prerequisite for effective risk assessments.
  Risk assessments take into account threats, vulnerabilities, likelihood, and impact
  to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the
  Nation based on the operation and use of information systems. Risk assessments also
  take into account risk from external parties (e.g., service providers, contractors
  operating information systems on behalf of the organization, individuals accessing
  organizational information systems, outsourcing entities). In accordance with OMB
  policy and related E-authentication initiatives, authentication of public users
  accessing federal information systems may also be required to protect nonpublic
  or privacy-related information. As such, organizational assessments of risk also
  address public access to federal information systems.

  Risk assessments (either formal or informal) can be conducted at all three tiers
  in the risk management hierarchy (i.e., organization level, mission/business process
  level, or information system level) and at any phase in the system development life
  cycle. Risk assessments can also be conducted at various steps in the Risk Management
  Framework, including categorization, security control selection, security control
  implementation, security control assessment, information system authorization, and
  security control monitoring. RA-3 is noteworthy in that the control must be partially
  implemented prior to the implementation of other controls in order to complete the
  first two steps in the Risk Management Framework. Risk assessments can play an important
  role in security control selection processes, particularly during the application
  of tailoring guidance, which includes security control supplementation.

  analysis, or a hybrid of the three approaches. Organizations can employ these analysis
  approaches in a variety of tools (e.g., web-based application scanners, static analysis
  tools, binary analyzers) and in source code reviews. Vulnerability scanning includes,
  for example: (i) scanning for patch levels; (ii) scanning for functions, ports,
  protocols, and services that should not be accessible to users or devices; and (iii)
  scanning for improperly configured or incorrectly operating information flow control
  mechanisms. Organizations consider using tools that express vulnerabilities in the
  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) naming convention and that use the Open
  Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL) to determine/test for the presence of vulnerabilities.
  Suggested sources for vulnerability information include the Common Weakness Enumeration
  (CWE) listing and the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). In addition, security
  control assessments such as red team exercises provide other sources of potential
  vulnerabilities for which to scan. Organizations also consider using tools that

family: SYSTEM AND SERVICES ACQUISITION
supplemental-guidance: A well-defined system development life cycle provides the foundation
  for the successful development, implementation, and operation of organizational
  information systems. To apply the required security controls within the system development
  life cycle requires a basic understanding of information security, threats, vulnerabilities,
  adverse impacts, and risk to critical missions/business functions. The security
  engineering principles in SA-8 cannot be properly applied if individuals that design,
  code, and test information systems and system components (including information
  technology products) do not understand security. Therefore, organizations include
  qualified personnel, for example, chief information security officers, security
  architects, security engineers, and information system security officers in system
  development life cycle activities to ensure that security requirements are incorporated
  into organizational information systems. It is equally important that developers
  include individuals on the development team that possess the requisite security
  expertise and skills to ensure that needed security capabilities are effectively
  integrated into the information system. Security awareness and training programs
  can help ensure that individuals having key security roles and responsibilities
  have the appropriate experience, skills, and expertise to conduct assigned system
  development life cycle activities. The effective integration of security requirements
  into enterprise architecture also helps to ensure that important security considerations

  Information system components are discrete, identifiable information technology
  assets (e.g., hardware, software, or firmware) that represent the building blocks
  of an information system. Information system components include commercial information
  technology products. Security functional requirements include security capabilities,
  security functions, and security mechanisms. Security strength requirements associated
  with such capabilities, functions, and mechanisms include degree of correctness,
  completeness, resistance to direct attack, and resistance to tampering or bypass.
  Security assurance requirements include: (i) development processes, procedures,
  practices, and methodologies; and (ii) evidence from development and assessment
  activities providing grounds for confidence that the required security functionality
  has been implemented and the required security strength has been achieved. Security
  documentation requirements address all phases of the system development life cycle.

  Security functionality, assurance, and documentation requirements are expressed
  in terms of security controls and control enhancements that have been selected through
  the tailoring process. The security control tailoring process includes, for example,
  the specification of parameter values through the use of assignment and selection
  statements and the specification of platform dependencies and implementation information.
  Security documentation provides user and administrator guidance regarding the implementation
  and operation of security controls. The level of detail required in security documentation
  is based on the security category or classification level of the information system
  and the degree to which organizations depend on the stated security capability,
  functions, or mechanisms to meet overall risk response expectations (as defined
  in the organizational risk management strategy). Security requirements can also
  include organizationally mandated configuration settings specifying allowed functions,
  ports, protocols, and services. Acceptance criteria for information systems, information
  system components, and information system services are defined in the same manner
  as such criteria for any organizational acquisition or procurement. The Federal
  Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Section 7.103 contains information security requirements
  from FISMA.

family: SYSTEM AND SERVICES ACQUISITION
supplemental-guidance: This control helps organizational personnel understand the
  implementation and operation of security controls associated with information systems,
  system components, and information system services. Organizations consider establishing
  specific measures to determine the quality/completeness of the content provided.
  The inability to obtain needed documentation may occur, for example, due to the
  age of the information system/component or lack of support from developers and contractors.
  In those situations, organizations may need to recreate selected documentation if
  such documentation is essential to the effective implementation or operation of
  security controls. The level of protection provided for selected information system,
  component, or service documentation is commensurate with the security category or
  classification of the system. For example, documentation associated with a key DoD
  weapons system or command and control system would typically require a higher level
  of protection than a routine administrative system. Documentation that addresses
  information system vulnerabilities may also require an increased level of protection.
  Secure operation of the information system, includes, for example, initially starting
  the system and resuming secure system operation after any lapse in system operation.

family: SYSTEM AND SERVICES ACQUISITION
supplemental-guidance: External information system services are services that are
  implemented outside of the authorization boundaries of organizational information
  systems. This includes services that are used by, but not a part of, organizational
  information systems. FISMA and OMB policy require that organizations using external
  service providers that are processing, storing, or transmitting federal information
  or operating information systems on behalf of the federal government ensure that
  such providers meet the same security requirements that federal agencies are required
  to meet. Organizations establish relationships with external service providers in
  a variety of ways including, for example, through joint ventures, business partnerships,
  contracts, interagency agreements, lines of business arrangements, licensing agreements,
  and supply chain exchanges. The responsibility for managing risks from the use of
  external information system services remains with authorizing officials. For services
  external to organizations, a chain of trust requires that organizations establish
  and retain a level of confidence that each participating provider in the potentially
  complex consumer-provider relationship provides adequate protection for the services
  rendered. The extent and nature of this chain of trust varies based on the relationships
  between organizations and the external providers. Organizations document the basis

family: SYSTEM AND SERVICES ACQUISITION
supplemental-guidance: Developmental security testing/evaluation occurs at all post-design
  phases of the system development life cycle. Such testing/evaluation confirms that
  the required security controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended,
  enforcing the desired security policy, and meeting established security requirements.
  Security properties of information systems may be affected by the interconnection
  of system components or changes to those components. These interconnections or changes
  (e.g., upgrading or replacing applications and operating systems) may adversely
  affect previously implemented security controls. This control provides additional
  types of security testing/evaluation that developers can conduct to reduce or eliminate
  potential flaws. Testing custom software applications may require approaches such
  as static analysis, dynamic analysis, binary analysis, or a hybrid of the three
  approaches. Developers can employ these analysis approaches in a variety of tools
  (e.g., web-based application scanners, static analysis tools, binary analyzers)
  and in source code reviews. Security assessment plans provide the specific activities
  that developers plan to carry out including the types of analyses, testing, evaluation,
  and reviews of software and firmware components, the degree of rigor to be applied,
  and the types of artifacts produced during those processes. The depth of security
  testing/evaluation refers to the rigor and level of detail associated with the assessment
  process (e.g., black box, gray box, or white box testing). The coverage of security
  testing/evaluation refers to the scope (i.e., number and type) of the artifacts
  included in the assessment process. Contracts specify the acceptance criteria for
  security assessment plans, flaw remediation processes, and the evidence that the
  plans/processes have been diligently applied. Methods for reviewing and protecting
  assessment plans, evidence, and documentation are commensurate with the security

  supporting its critical missions/business functions; and

  b. Implements [Assignment: organization-defined assurance overlay] to achieve such
  trustworthiness.
family: SYSTEM AND SERVICES ACQUISITION
supplemental-guidance: >-
  This control helps organizations to make explicit trustworthiness decisions when
  designing, developing, and implementing information systems that are needed to conduct
  critical organizational missions/business functions. Trustworthiness is a characteristic/property
  of an information system that expresses the degree to which the system can be expected
  to preserve the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information
  it processes, stores, or transmits.  Trustworthy information systems are systems
  that are capable of being trusted to operate within defined levels of risk despite
  the environmental disruptions, human errors, and purposeful attacks that are expected
  to occur in the specified environments of operation. Trustworthy systems are important
  to mission/business success. Two factors affecting the trustworthiness of information
  systems include: (i) security functionality (i.e., the security features, functions,
  and/or mechanisms employed within the system and its environment of operation);
  and (ii) security assurance (i.e., the grounds for confidence that the security
  functionality is effective in its application). Developers, implementers, operators,
  and maintainers of organizational information systems can increase the level of
  assurance (and trustworthiness), for example, by employing well-defined security
  policy models, structured and rigorous hardware, software, and firmware development
  techniques, sound system/security engineering principles, and secure configuration
  settings (defined by a set of assurance-related security controls in Appendix E).

  Assurance is also based on the assessment of evidence produced during the system
  development life cycle. Critical missions/business functions are supported by high-impact
  systems and the associated assurance requirements for such systems. The additional
  assurance controls in Table E-4 in Appendix E (designated as optional) can be used
  to develop and implement high-assurance solutions for specific information systems
  and system components using the concept of overlays described in Appendix I. Organizations
  select assurance overlays that have been developed, validated, and approved for
  community adoption (e.g., cross-organization, governmentwide), limiting the development
  of such overlays on an organization-by-organization basis. Organizations can conduct
  criticality analyses as described in SA-14, to determine the information systems,
  system components, or information system services that require high-assurance solutions.
  Trustworthiness requirements and assurance overlays can be described in the security
  plans for organizational information systems.

family: SYSTEM AND SERVICES ACQUISITION
supplemental-guidance: Criticality analysis is a key tenet of supply chain risk management
  and informs the prioritization of supply chain protection activities such as attack
  surface reduction, use of all-source intelligence, and tailored acquisition strategies.
  Information system engineers can conduct an end-to-end functional decomposition
  of an information system to identify mission-critical functions and components.
  The functional decomposition includes the identification of core organizational
  missions supported by the system, decomposition into the specific functions to perform
  those missions, and traceability to the hardware, software, and firmware components
  that implement those functions, including when the functions are shared by many
  components within and beyond the information system boundary. Information system
  components that allow for unmediated access to critical components or functions
  are considered critical due to the inherent vulnerabilities such components create.
  Criticality is assessed in terms of the impact of the function or component failure
  on the ability of the component to complete the organizational missions supported
  by the information system. A criticality analysis is performed whenever an architecture
  or design is being developed or modified, including upgrades.

supplemental-guidance: The information system isolates security functions from nonsecurity
  functions by means of an isolation boundary (implemented via partitions and domains).
  Such isolation controls access to and protects the integrity of the hardware, software,
  and firmware that perform those security functions. Information systems implement
  code separation (i.e., separation of security functions from nonsecurity functions)
  in a number of ways, including, for example, through the provision of security kernels
  via processor rings or processor modes. For non-kernel code, security function isolation
  is often achieved through file system protections that serve to protect the code
  on disk, and address space protections that protect executing code. Information
  systems restrict access to security functions through the use of access control
  mechanisms and by implementing least privilege capabilities. While the ideal is
  for all of the code within the security function isolation boundary to only contain
  security-relevant code, it is sometimes necessary to include nonsecurity functions
  within the isolation boundary as an exception.

  web servers within managed interfaces and prohibiting external traffic that appears
  to be spoofing internal addresses. Organizations consider the shared nature of commercial
  telecommunications services in the implementation of security controls associated
  with the use of such services. Commercial telecommunications services are commonly
  based on network components and consolidated management systems shared by all attached
  commercial customers, and may also include third party-provided access lines and
  other service elements. Such transmission services may represent sources of increased
  risk despite contract security provisions.

description: 'The information system protects the [Selection (one or more): confidentiality;

family: SYSTEM AND COMMUNICATIONS PROTECTION
supplemental-guidance: This control applies to both internal and external networks
  and all types of information system components from which information can be transmitted
  (e.g., servers, mobile devices, notebook computers, printers, copiers, scanners,
  facsimile machines). Communication paths outside the physical protection of a controlled
  boundary are exposed to the possibility of interception and modification. Protecting
  the confidentiality and/or integrity of organizational information can be accomplished
  by physical means (e.g., by employing protected distribution systems) or by logical
  means (e.g., employing encryption techniques). Organizations relying on commercial
  providers offering transmission services as commodity services rather than as fully
  dedicated services (i.e., services which can be highly specialized to individual
  customer needs), may find it difficult to obtain the necessary assurances regarding
  the implementation of needed security controls for transmission confidentiality/integrity.
  In such situations, organizations determine what types of confidentiality/integrity
  services are available in standard, commercial telecommunication service packages.
  If it is infeasible or impractical to obtain the necessary security controls and
  assurances of control effectiveness through appropriate contracting vehicles, organizations
  implement appropriate compensating security controls or explicitly accept the additional
  risk.

  clients). DNS servers with external roles only process name and address resolution
  information requests from clients external to organizations (i.e., on external networks

family: SYSTEM AND COMMUNICATIONS PROTECTION
supplemental-guidance: Concealment and misdirection techniques can significantly reduce
  the targeting capability of adversaries (i.e., window of opportunity and available
  attack surface) to initiate and complete cyber attacks. For example, virtualization
  techniques provide organizations with the ability to disguise information systems,
  potentially reducing the likelihood of successful attacks without the cost of having
  multiple platforms. Increased use of concealment/misdirection techniques including,
  for example, randomness, uncertainty, and virtualization, may sufficiently confuse
  and mislead adversaries and subsequently increase the risk of discovery and/or exposing
  tradecraft. Concealment/misdirection techniques may also provide organizations additional
  time to successfully perform core missions and business functions. Because of the
  time and effort required to support concealment/misdirection techniques, it is anticipated
  that such techniques would be used by organizations on a very limited basis.

  increases the work factor of adversaries to adversely impact organizational operations,
  assets, and individuals. This control does not assume a single primary processing
  or storage location, and thus allows for parallel processing and storage.

family: SYSTEM AND COMMUNICATIONS PROTECTION
supplemental-guidance: Out-of-band channels include, for example, local (nonnetwork)
  accesses to information systems, network paths physically separate from network
  paths used for operational traffic, or nonelectronic paths such as the US Postal
  Service. This is in contrast with using the same channels (i.e., in-band channels)
  that carry routine operational traffic. Out-of-band channels do not have the same
  vulnerability/exposure as in-band channels, and hence the confidentiality, integrity,
  or availability compromises of in-band channels will not compromise the out-of-band
  channels. Organizations may employ out-of-band channels in the delivery or transmission
  of many organizational items including, for example, identifiers/authenticators,
  configuration management changes for hardware, firmware, or software, cryptographic
  key management information, security updates, system/data backups, maintenance information,
  and malicious code protection updates.

family: SYSTEM AND COMMUNICATIONS PROTECTION
supplemental-guidance: 'Operations security (OPSEC) is a systematic process by which
  potential adversaries can be denied information about the capabilities and intentions
  of organizations by identifying, controlling, and protecting generally unclassified
  information that specifically relates to the planning and execution of sensitive
  organizational activities. The OPSEC process involves five steps: (i) identification
  of critical information (e.g., the security categorization process); (ii) analysis
  of threats; (iii) analysis of vulnerabilities; (iv) assessment of risks; and (v)
  the application of appropriate countermeasures. OPSEC safeguards are applied to
  both organizational information systems and the environments in which those systems
  operate. OPSEC safeguards help to protect the confidentiality of key information
  including, for example, limiting the sharing of information with suppliers and potential
  suppliers of information system components, information technology products and
  services, and with other non-organizational elements and individuals. Information
  critical to mission/business success includes, for example, user identities, element
  uses, suppliers, supply chain processes, functional and security requirements, system
  design specifications, testing protocols, and security control implementation details.'

supplemental-guidance: Information systems can maintain separate execution domains
  for each executing process by assigning each process a separate address space. Each
  information system process has a distinct address space so that communication between
  processes is performed in a manner controlled through the security functions, and
  one process cannot modify the executing code of another process. Maintaining separate
  execution domains for executing processes can be achieved, for example, by implementing
  separate address spaces. This capability is available in most commercial operating
  systems that employ multi-state processor technologies.

  organization-defined time period] of the release of the updates; and

  d. Incorporates flaw remediation into the organizational configuration management
  process.
family: SYSTEM AND INFORMATION INTEGRITY
supplemental-guidance: Organizations identify information systems affected by announced
  software flaws including potential vulnerabilities resulting from those flaws, and
  report this information to designated organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities. Security-relevant software updates include, for example,
  patches, service packs, hot fixes, and anti-virus signatures. Organizations also
  address flaws discovered during security assessments, continuous monitoring, incident
  response activities, and system error handling. Organizations take advantage of
  available resources such as the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) or Common Vulnerabilities
  and Exposures (CVE) databases in remediating flaws discovered in organizational
  information systems. By incorporating flaw remediation into ongoing configuration
  management processes, required/anticipated remediation actions can be tracked and
  verified. Flaw remediation actions that can be tracked and verified include, for
  example, determining whether organizations follow US-CERT guidance and Information
  Assurance Vulnerability Alerts. Organization-defined time periods for updating security-relevant
  software and firmware may vary based on a variety of factors including, for example,
  the security category of the information system or the criticality of the update
  (i.e., severity of the vulnerability related to the discovered flaw). Some types
  of flaw remediation may require more testing than other types. Organizations determine
  the degree and type of testing needed for the specific type of flaw remediation
  activity under consideration and also the types of changes that are to be configuration-managed.
  In some situations, organizations may determine that the testing of software and/or
  firmware updates is not necessary or practical, for example, when implementing simple
  anti-virus signature updates. Organizations may also consider in testing decisions,
  whether security-relevant software or firmware updates are obtained from authorized
  sources with appropriate digital signatures.

  to malicious code detection; and

  d. Addresses the receipt of false positives during malicious code detection and
  eradication and the resulting potential impact on the availability of the information
  system.
family: SYSTEM AND INFORMATION INTEGRITY
supplemental-guidance: Information system entry and exit points include, for example,
  firewalls, electronic mail servers, web servers, proxy servers, remote-access servers,
  workstations, notebook computers, and mobile devices. Malicious code includes, for
  example, viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and spyware. Malicious code can also be
  encoded in various formats (e.g., UUENCODE, Unicode), contained within compressed
  or hidden files, or hidden in files using steganography. Malicious code can be transported
  by different means including, for example, web accesses, electronic mail, electronic
  mail attachments, and portable storage devices. Malicious code insertions occur
  through the exploitation of information system vulnerabilities. Malicious code protection
  mechanisms include, for example, anti-virus signature definitions and reputation-based
  technologies. A variety of technologies and methods exist to limit or eliminate
  the effects of malicious code. Pervasive configuration management and comprehensive
  software integrity controls may be effective in preventing execution of unauthorized
  code. In addition to commercial off-the-shelf software, malicious code may also
  be present in custom-built software. This could include, for example, logic bombs,
  back doors, and other types of cyber attacks that could affect organizational missions/business
  functions. Traditional malicious code protection mechanisms cannot always detect
  such code. In these situations, organizations rely instead on other safeguards including,
  for example, secure coding practices, configuration management and control, trusted
  procurement processes, and monitoring practices to help ensure that software does
  not perform functions other than the functions intended. Organizations may determine
  that in response to the detection of malicious code, different actions may be warranted.
  For example, organizations can define actions in response to malicious code detection
  during periodic scans, actions in response to detection of malicious downloads,
  and/or actions in response to detection of maliciousness when attempting to open
  or execute files.

  to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] [Selection (one or more):
  as needed; [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]].
family: SYSTEM AND INFORMATION INTEGRITY
supplemental-guidance: Information system monitoring includes external and internal
  monitoring. External monitoring includes the observation of events occurring at
  the information system boundary (i.e., part of perimeter defense and boundary protection).
  Internal monitoring includes the observation of events occurring within the information
  system. Organizations can monitor information systems, for example, by observing
  audit activities in real time or by observing other system aspects such as access
  patterns, characteristics of access, and other actions. The monitoring objectives
  may guide determination of the events. Information system monitoring capability
  is achieved through a variety of tools and techniques (e.g., intrusion detection
  systems, intrusion prevention systems, malicious code protection software, scanning
  tools, audit record monitoring software, network monitoring software). Strategic
  locations for monitoring devices include, for example, selected perimeter locations
  and near server farms supporting critical applications, with such devices typically
  being employed at the managed interfaces associated with controls SC-7 and AC-17.
  Einstein network monitoring devices from the Department of Homeland Security can
  also be included as monitoring devices. The granularity of monitoring information
  collected is based on organizational monitoring objectives and the capability of
  information systems to support such objectives. Specific types of transactions of
  interest include, for example, Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) traffic that
  bypasses HTTP proxies. Information system monitoring is an integral part of organizational
  continuous monitoring and incident response programs. Output from system monitoring
  serves as input to continuous monitoring and incident response programs. A network
  connection is any connection with a device that communicates through a network (e.g.,
  local area network, Internet). A remote connection is any connection with a device
  communicating through an external network (e.g., the Internet). Local, network,
  and remote connections can be either wired or wireless.

family: SYSTEM AND INFORMATION INTEGRITY
supplemental-guidance: Checking the valid syntax and semantics of information system
  inputs (e.g., character set, length, numerical range, and acceptable values) verifies
  that inputs match specified definitions for format and content. Software applications
  typically follow well-defined protocols that use structured messages (i.e., commands
  or queries) to communicate between software modules or system components. Structured
  messages can contain raw or unstructured data interspersed with metadata or control
  information. If software applications use attacker-supplied inputs to construct
  structured messages without properly encoding such messages, then the attacker could
  insert malicious commands or special characters that can cause the data to be interpreted
  as control information or metadata. Consequently, the module or component that receives
  the tainted output will perform the wrong operations or otherwise interpret the
  data incorrectly. Prescreening inputs prior to passing to interpreters prevents
  the content from being unintentionally interpreted as commands. Input validation
  helps to ensure accurate and correct inputs and prevent attacks such as cross-site
  scripting and a variety of injection attacks.

  The organization:

  a. Determines mean time to failure (MTTF) for [Assignment: organization-defined
  information system components] in specific environments of operation; and

  b. Provides substitute information system components and a means to exchange active
  and standby components at [Assignment: organization-defined MTTF substitution criteria].
family: SYSTEM AND INFORMATION INTEGRITY
supplemental-guidance: While MTTF is primarily a reliability issue, this control addresses
  potential failures of specific information system components that provide security
  capability. Failure rates reflect installation-specific consideration, not industry-average.
  Organizations define criteria for substitution of information system components
  based on MTTF value with consideration for resulting potential harm from component
  failures. Transfer of responsibilities between active and standby components does
  not compromise safety, operational readiness, or security capability (e.g., preservation
  of state variables). Standby components remain available at all times except for
  maintenance issues or recovery failures in progress.

family: SYSTEM AND INFORMATION INTEGRITY
supplemental-guidance: >-
  This control mitigates risk from advanced persistent threats (APTs) by significantly
  reducing the targeting capability of adversaries (i.e., window of opportunity and
  available attack surface) to initiate and complete cyber attacks. By implementing
  the concept of non-persistence for selected information system components, organizations
  can provide a known state computing resource for a specific period of time that
  does not give adversaries sufficient time on target to exploit vulnerabilities in
  organizational information systems and the environments in which those systems operate.
  Since the advanced persistent threat is a high-end threat with regard to capability,
  intent, and targeting, organizations assume that over an extended period of time,
  a percentage of cyber attacks will be successful. Non-persistent information system
  components and services are activated as required using protected information and
  terminated periodically or upon the end of sessions. Non-persistence increases the
  work factor of adversaries in attempting to compromise or breach organizational
  information systems.

  Non-persistent system components can be implemented, for example, by periodically
  re-imaging components or by using a variety of common virtualization techniques.
  Non-persistent services can be implemented using virtualization techniques as part
  of virtual machines or as new instances of processes on physical machines (either
  persistent or non-persistent).The benefit of periodic refreshes of information system
  components/services is that it does not require organizations to first determine
  whether compromises of components or services have occurred (something that may
  often be difficult for organizations to determine). The refresh of selected information
  system components and services occurs with sufficient frequency to prevent the spread
  or intended impact of attacks, but not with such frequency that it makes the information
  system unstable. In some instances, refreshes of critical components and services
  may be done periodically in order to hinder the ability of adversaries to exploit
  optimum windows of vulnerabilities.

  of the security program management controls and common controls in place or planned
  for meeting those requirements;

  a.2. Includes the identification and assignment of roles, responsibilities, management
  commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance;

  a.3. Reflects coordination among organizational entities responsible for the different
  aspects of information security (i.e., technical, physical, personnel, cyber-physical);
  and

  a.4. Is approved by a senior official with responsibility and accountability for
  the risk being incurred to organizational operations (including mission, functions,
  image, and reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations,
  and the Nation;

  b. Reviews the organization-wide information security program plan [Assignment:
  organization-defined frequency];

  c. Updates the plan to address organizational changes and problems identified during
  plan implementation or security control assessments; and

  d. Protects the information security program plan from unauthorized disclosure and
  modification.
family: PROGRAM MANAGEMENT
supplemental-guidance: >-
  Information security program plans can be represented in single documents or compilations
  of documents at the discretion of organizations. The plans document the program
  management controls and organization-defined common controls. Information security
  program plans provide sufficient information about the program management controls/common
  controls (including specification of parameters for any assignment and selection
  statements either explicitly or by reference) to enable implementations that are
  unambiguously compliant with the intent of the plans and a determination of the
  risk to be incurred if the plans are implemented as intended.

  The security plans for individual information systems and the organization-wide
  information security program plan together, provide complete coverage for all security
  controls employed within the organization. Common controls are documented in an
  appendix to the organization�s information security program plan unless the controls
  are included in a separate security plan for an information system (e.g., security
  controls employed as part of an intrusion detection system providing organization-wide
  boundary protection inherited by one or more organizational information systems).
  The organization-wide information security program plan will indicate which separate
  security plans contain descriptions of common controls.

  Organizations have the flexibility to describe common controls in a single document
  or in multiple documents. In the case of multiple documents, the documents describing
  common controls are included as attachments to the information security program
  plan. If the information security program plan contains multiple documents, the
  organization specifies in each document the organizational official or officials
  responsible for the development, implementation, assessment, authorization, and
  monitoring of the respective common controls. For example, the organization may
  require that the Facilities Management Office develop, implement, assess, authorize,
  and continuously monitor common physical and environmental protection controls from
  the PE family when such controls are not associated with a particular information
  system but instead, support multiple information systems.

supplemental-guidance: The enterprise architecture developed by the organization is
  aligned with the Federal Enterprise Architecture. The integration of information
  security requirements and associated security controls into the organization�s enterprise
  architecture helps to ensure that security considerations are addressed by organizations
  early in the system development life cycle and are directly and explicitly related
  to the organization�s mission/business processes. This process of security requirements
  integration also embeds into the enterprise architecture, an integral information
  security architecture consistent with organizational risk management and information
  security strategies. For PM-7, the information security architecture is developed
  at a system-of-systems level (organization-wide), representing all of the organizational
  information systems. For PL-8, the information security architecture is developed
  at a level representing an individual information system but at the same time, is
  consistent with the information security architecture defined for the organization.
  Security requirements and security control integration are most effectively accomplished
  through the application of the Risk Management Framework and supporting security
  standards and guidelines. The Federal Segment Architecture Methodology provides

family: PROGRAM MANAGEMENT
supplemental-guidance: >-
  Organizations handling classified information are required, under Executive Order
  13587 and the National Policy on Insider Threat, to establish insider threat programs.
  The standards and guidelines that apply to insider threat programs in classified
  environments can also be employed effectively to improve the security of Controlled
  Unclassified Information in non-national security systems. Insider threat programs
  include security controls to detect and prevent malicious insider activity through
  the centralized integration and analysis of both technical and non-technical information
  to identify potential insider threat concerns. A senior organizational official
  is designated by the department/agency head as the responsible individual to implement
  and provide oversight for the program. In addition to the centralized integration
  and analysis capability, insider threat programs as a minimum, prepare department/agency
  insider threat policies and implementation plans, conduct host-based user monitoring
  of individual employee activities on government-owned classified computers, provide
  insider threat awareness training to employees, receive access to information from
  all offices within the department/agency (e.g., human resources, legal, physical
  security, personnel security, information technology, information system security,
  and law enforcement) for insider threat analysis, and conduct self-assessments of
  department/agency insider threat posture.

  Insider threat programs can leverage the existence of incident handling teams organizations
  may already have in place, such as computer security incident response teams. Human
  resources records are especially important in this effort, as there is compelling
  evidence to show that some types of insider crimes are often preceded by nontechnical
  behaviors in the workplace (e.g., ongoing patterns of disgruntled behavior and conflicts
  with coworkers and other colleagues). These precursors can better inform and guide
  organizational officials in more focused, targeted monitoring efforts. The participation
  of a legal team is important to ensure that all monitoring activities are performed
  in accordance with appropriate legislation, directives, regulations, policies, standards,
  and guidelines.

  mitigations that organizations have found are effective against certain types of
  threats, threat intelligence (i.e., indications and warnings about threats that
  are likely to occur). Threat information sharing may be bilateral (e.g., government-commercial
  cooperatives, government-government cooperatives), or multilateral (e.g., organizations

description: 'The information system implements the following dynamic privilege management
  capabilities: [Assignment: organization-defined list of dynamic privilege management
  capabilities].'
family: ACCESS CONTROL
supplemental-guidance: In contrast to conventional access control approaches which
  employ static information system accounts and predefined sets of user privileges,
  dynamic access control approaches (e.g., service-oriented architectures) rely on
  run time access control decisions facilitated by dynamic privilege management. While
  user identities may remain relatively constant over time, user privileges may change
  more frequently based on ongoing mission/business requirements and operational needs
  of organizations. Dynamic privilege management can include, for example, the immediate
  revocation of privileges from users, as opposed to requiring that users terminate
  and restart their sessions to reflect any changes in privileges. Dynamic privilege
  management can also refer to mechanisms that change the privileges of users based
  on dynamic rules as opposed to editing specific user profiles. This type of privilege
  management includes, for example, automatic adjustments of privileges if users are
  operating out of their normal work times, or if information systems are under duress
  or in emergency maintenance situations. This control enhancement also includes the
  ancillary effects of privilege changes, for example, the potential changes to encryption
  keys used for communications. Dynamic privilege management can support requirements
  for information system resiliency.

  The information system enforces [Assignment: organization-defined mandatory access
  control policy] over all subjects and objects where the policy:

  (a) Is uniformly enforced across all subjects and objects within the boundary of
  the information system;

  (b) Specifies that a subject that has been granted access to information is constrained
  from doing any of the following;

  (b)(1) Passing the information to unauthorized subjects or objects;

  (b)(2) Granting its privileges to other subjects;

  (b)(3) Changing one or more security attributes on subjects, objects, the information
  system, or information system components;

  (b)(4) Choosing the security attributes and attribute values to be associated with
  newly created or modified objects; or

  (b)(5) Changing the rules governing access control; and

  (c) Specifies that [Assignment: organization-defined subjects] may explicitly be
  granted [Assignment: organization-defined privileges (i.e., they are trusted subjects)]
  such that they are not limited by some or all of the above constraints.
family: ACCESS CONTROL
supplemental-guidance: Mandatory access control as defined in this control enhancement
  is synonymous with nondiscretionary access control, and is not constrained only
  to certain historical uses (e.g., implementations using the Bell-LaPadula Model).
  The above class of mandatory access control policies constrains what actions subjects
  can take with information obtained from data objects for which they have already
  been granted access, thus preventing the subjects from passing the information to
  unauthorized subjects and objects. This class of mandatory access control policies
  also constrains what actions subjects can take with respect to the propagation of
  access control privileges; that is, a subject with a privilege cannot pass that
  privilege to other subjects. The policy is uniformly enforced over all subjects
  and objects to which the information system has control. Otherwise, the access control
  policy can be circumvented. This enforcement typically is provided via an implementation
  that meets the reference monitor concept (see AC-25). The policy is bounded by the
  information system boundary (i.e., once the information is passed outside of the
  control of the system, additional means may be required to ensure that the constraints
  on the information remain in effect). The trusted subjects described above are granted
  privileges consistent with the concept of least privilege (see AC-6). Trusted subjects
  are only given the minimum privileges relative to the above policy necessary for
  satisfying organizational mission/business needs. The control is most applicable
  when there is some policy mandate (e.g., law, Executive Order, directive, or regulation)
  that establishes a policy regarding access to sensitive/classified information and
  some users of the information system are not authorized access to all sensitive/classified
  information resident in the information system. This control can operate in conjunction
  with AC-3 (4). A subject that is constrained in its operation by policies governed
  by this control is still able to operate under the less rigorous constraints of
  AC-3 (4), but policies governed by this control take precedence over the less rigorous
  constraints of AC-3 (4). For example, while a mandatory access control policy imposes
  a constraint preventing a subject from passing information to another subject operating
  at a different sensitivity label, AC-3 (4) permits the subject to pass the information
  to any subject with the same sensitivity label as the subject.

description: >-
  The information system enforces [Assignment: organization-defined discretionary
  access control policy] over defined subjects and objects where the policy specifies
  that a subject that has been granted access to information can do one or more of
  the following:

  (a) Pass the information to any other subjects or objects;

  (b) Grant its privileges to other subjects;

  (c) Change security attributes on subjects, objects, the information system, or
  the information system�s components;

  (d) Choose the security attributes to be associated with newly created or revised
  objects; or

  (e) Change the rules governing access control.
family: ACCESS CONTROL
supplemental-guidance: When discretionary access control policies are implemented,
  subjects are not constrained with regard to what actions they can take with information
  for which they have already been granted access. Thus, subjects that have been granted
  access to information are not prevented from passing (i.e., the subjects have the
  discretion to pass) the information to other subjects or objects. This control enhancement
  can operate in conjunction with AC-3 (3). A subject that is constrained in its operation
  by policies governed by AC-3 (3) is still able to operate under the less rigorous
  constraints of this control enhancement. Thus, while AC-3 (3) imposes constraints
  preventing a subject from passing information to another subject operating at a
  different sensitivity level, AC-3 (4) permits the subject to pass the information
  to any subject at the same sensitivity level. The policy is bounded by the information
  system boundary. Once the information is passed outside of the control of the information
  system, additional means may be required to ensure that the constraints remain in
  effect. While the older, more traditional definitions of discretionary access control
  require identity-based access control, that limitation is not required for this
  use of discretionary access control.

family: ACCESS CONTROL
supplemental-guidance: Role-based access control (RBAC) is an access control policy
  that restricts information system access to authorized users. Organizations can
  create specific roles based on job functions and the authorizations (i.e., privileges)
  to perform needed operations on organizational information systems associated with
  the organization-defined roles. When users are assigned to the organizational roles,
  they inherit the authorizations or privileges defined for those roles. RBAC simplifies
  privilege administration for organizations because privileges are not assigned directly
  to every user (which can be a significant number of individuals for mid- to large-size
  organizations) but are instead acquired through role assignments. RBAC can be implemented
  either as a mandatory or discretionary form of access control. For organizations
  implementing RBAC with mandatory access controls, the requirements in AC-3 (3) define
  the scope of the subjects and objects covered by the policy.

  opened or until the next time the subject attempts a new access to the object. Revocation
  based on changes to security labels may take effect immediately. Organizations can

  (a) The receiving [Assignment: organization-defined information system or system
  component] provides [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards]; and

  (b) [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards] are used to validate
  the appropriateness of the information designated for release.
family: ACCESS CONTROL
supplemental-guidance: Information systems can only protect organizational information
  within the confines of established system boundaries. Additional security safeguards
  may be needed to ensure that such information is adequately protected once it is
  passed beyond the established information system boundaries. Examples of information
  leaving the system boundary include transmitting information to an external information
  system or printing the information on one of its printers. In cases where the information
  system is unable to make a determination of the adequacy of the protections provided
  by entities outside its boundary, as a mitigating control, organizations determine
  procedurally whether the external information systems are providing adequate security.
  The means used to determine the adequacy of the security provided by external information
  systems include, for example, conducting inspections or periodic testing, establishing
  agreements between the organization and its counterpart organizations, or some other
  process. The means used by external entities to protect the information received
  need not be the same as those used by the organization, but the means employed are
  sufficient to provide consistent adjudication of the security policy to protect
  the information. This control enhancement requires information systems to employ
  technical or procedural means to validate the information prior to releasing it
  to external systems. For example, if the information system passes information to
  another system controlled by another organization, technical means are employed
  to validate that the security attributes associated with the exported information
  are appropriate for the receiving system. Alternatively, if the information system
  passes information to a printer in organization-controlled space, procedural means
  can be employed to ensure that only appropriately authorized individuals gain access
  to the printer. This control enhancement is most applicable when there is some policy
  mandate (e.g., law, Executive Order, directive, or regulation) that establishes
  policy regarding access to the information, and that policy applies beyond the realm
  of a particular information system or organization.

supplemental-guidance: Metadata is information used to describe the characteristics
  of data. Metadata can include structural metadata describing data structures (e.g.,
  data format, syntax, and semantics) or descriptive metadata describing data contents
  (e.g., age, location, telephone number). Enforcing allowed information flows based
  on metadata enables simpler and more effective flow control. Organizations consider
  the trustworthiness of metadata with regard to data accuracy (i.e., knowledge that
  the metadata values are correct with respect to the data), data integrity (i.e.,
  protecting against unauthorized changes to metadata tags), and the binding of metadata
  to the data payload (i.e., ensuring sufficiently strong binding techniques with
  appropriate levels of assurance).

supplemental-guidance: 'Organization-defined security policy filters can address data
  structures and content. For example, security policy filters for data structures
  can check for maximum file lengths, maximum field sizes, and data/file types (for
  structured and unstructured data). Security policy filters for data content can
  check for specific words (e.g., dirty/clean word filters), enumerated values or
  data value ranges, and hidden content. Structured data permits the interpretation
  of data content by applications. Unstructured data typically refers to digital information
  without a particular data structure or with a data structure that does not facilitate
  the development of rule sets to address the particular sensitivity of the information
  conveyed by the data or the associated flow enforcement decisions. Unstructured
  data consists of: (i) bitmap objects that are inherently non language-based (i.e.,
  image, video, or audio files); and (ii) textual objects that are based on written
  or printed languages (e.g., commercial off-the-shelf word processing documents,
  spreadsheets, or emails). Organizations can implement more than one security policy
  filter to meet information flow control objectives (e.g., employing clean word lists
  in conjunction with dirty word lists may help to reduce false positives).'

  within information systems is of significant importance with regard to conducting
  automated access enforcement and flow enforcement actions. The association of such
  security attributes can be accomplished with technologies/techniques providing different
  levels of assurance. For example, information systems can cryptographically bind
  security attributes to information using digital signatures with the supporting
  cryptographic keys protected by hardware devices (sometimes known as hardware roots
  of trust).

  to provide the requisite levels of assurance for security attribute reassignment
  activities. The validation is facilitated by ensuring that re-grading mechanisms
  are single purpose and of limited function. Since security attribute reassignments
  can affect security policy enforcement actions (e.g., access/flow enforcement decisions),
  using trustworthy re-grading mechanisms is necessary to ensure that such mechanisms
  perform in a consistent/correct mode of operation.

description: >-
  The organization permits authorized individuals to use an external information system
  to access the information system or to process, store, or transmit organization-controlled
  information only when the organization:

  (a) Verifies the implementation of required security controls on the external system
  as specified in the organization�s information security policy and security plan;
  or

  (b) Retains approved information system connection or processing agreements with
  the organizational entity hosting the external information system.
family: ACCESS CONTROL
supplemental-guidance: This control enhancement recognizes that there are circumstances
  where individuals using external information systems (e.g., contractors, coalition
  partners) need to access organizational information systems. In those situations,
  organizations need confidence that the external information systems contain the
  necessary security safeguards (i.e., security controls), so as not to compromise,
  damage, or otherwise harm organizational information systems. Verification that
  the required security controls have been implemented can be achieved, for example,
  by third-party, independent assessments, attestations, or other means, depending
  on the confidence level required by organizations.

  the risk is sufficiently high as to prohibit such use. In other cases, it may be
  such that the use of non-organizationally owned devices is allowed but restricted
  in some way. Restrictions include, for example: (i) requiring the implementation
  of organization-approved security controls prior to authorizing such connections;
  (ii) limiting access to certain types of information, services, or applications;
  (iii) using virtualization techniques to limit processing and storage activities
  to servers or other system components provisioned by the organization; and (iv)

family: ACCESS CONTROL
supplemental-guidance: In distributed information systems, authorization processes
  and access control decisions may occur in separate parts of the systems. In such
  instances, authorization information is transmitted securely so timely access control
  decisions can be enforced at the appropriate locations. To support the access control
  decisions, it may be necessary to transmit as part of the access authorization information,
  supporting security attributes. This is due to the fact that in distributed information
  systems, there are various access control decisions that need to be made and different
  entities (e.g., services) make these decisions in a serial fashion, each requiring
  some security attributes to make the decisions. Protecting access authorization
  information (i.e., access control decisions) ensures that such information cannot
  be altered, spoofed, or otherwise compromised during transmission.

  is of paramount importance. In other situations, user identification information
  is simply not needed for access control decisions and, especially in the case of

family: AWARENESS AND TRAINING
supplemental-guidance: A well-trained workforce provides another organizational safeguard
  that can be employed as part of a defense-in-depth strategy to protect organizations
  against malicious code coming in to organizations via email or the web applications.
  Personnel are trained to look for indications of potentially suspicious email (e.g.,
  receiving an unexpected email, receiving an email containing strange or poor grammar,
  or receiving an email from an unfamiliar sender but who appears to be from a known
  sponsor or contractor). Personnel are also trained on how to respond to such suspicious
  email or web communications (e.g., not opening attachments, not clicking on embedded
  web links, and checking the source of email addresses). For this process to work
  effectively, all organizational personnel are trained and made aware of what constitutes
  suspicious communications. Training personnel on how to recognize anomalous behaviors
  in organizational information systems can potentially provide early warning for
  the presence of malicious code. Recognition of such anomalous behavior by organizational
  personnel can supplement automated malicious code detection and protection tools
  and systems employed by organizations.

family: AUDIT AND ACCOUNTABILITY
supplemental-guidance: This control enhancement does not require vulnerability scanning,
  the generation of performance data, or information system monitoring. Rather, the
  enhancement requires that the analysis of information being otherwise produced in
  these areas is integrated with the analysis of audit information. Security Event
  and Information Management System tools can facilitate audit record aggregation/consolidation
  from multiple information system components as well as audit record correlation
  and analysis. The use of standardized audit record analysis scripts developed by
  organizations (with localized script adjustments, as necessary) provides more cost-effective
  approaches for analyzing audit record information collected. The correlation of
  audit record information with vulnerability scanning information is important in
  determining the veracity of vulnerability scans and correlating attack detection
  events with scanning results. Correlation with performance data can help uncover
  denial of service attacks or cyber attacks resulting in unauthorized use of resources.
  Correlation with system monitoring information can assist in uncovering attacks
  and in better relating audit information to operational situations.

  suspicious, inappropriate, unusual, or malevolent activity.
family: AUDIT AND ACCOUNTABILITY
supplemental-guidance: The correlation of physical audit information and audit logs
  from information systems may assist organizations in identifying examples of suspicious
  behavior or supporting evidence of such behavior. For example, the correlation of
  an individual�s identity for logical access to certain information systems with
  the additional physical security information that the individual was actually present
  at the facility when the logical access occurred, may prove to be useful in investigations.

  processes, roles, and/or users associated with the review, analysis, and reporting
  of audit records through account management techniques. Specifying permitted actions
  on audit information is a way to enforce the principle of least privilege. Permitted
  actions are enforced by the information system and include, for example, read, write,

short-title: AU-6 (9)
description: The organization correlates information from nontechnical sources with

family: AUDIT AND ACCOUNTABILITY
supplemental-guidance: Nontechnical sources include, for example, human resources
  records documenting organizational policy violations (e.g., sexual harassment incidents,
  improper use of organizational information assets). Such information can lead organizations
  to a more directed analytical effort to detect potential malicious insider activity.
  Due to the sensitive nature of the information available from nontechnical sources,
  organizations limit access to such information to minimize the potential for the
  inadvertent release of privacy-related information to individuals that do not have
  a need to know. Thus, correlation of information from nontechnical sources with
  audit information generally occurs only when individuals are suspected of being
  involved in a security incident. Organizations obtain legal advice prior to initiating
  such actions.

  information systems under assessment or to the determination of security control
  effectiveness. To achieve impartiality, assessors should not: (i) create a mutual
  or conflicting interest with the organizations where the assessments are being conducted;
  (ii) assess their own work; (iii) act as management or employees of the organizations
  they are serving; or (iv) place themselves in positions of advocacy for the organizations
  acquiring their services. Independent assessments can be obtained from elements
  within organizations or can be contracted to public or private sector entities outside
  of organizations. Authorizing officials determine the required level of independence
  based on the security categories of information systems and/or the ultimate risk
  to organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals. Authorizing
  officials also determine if the level of assessor independence provides sufficient
  assurance that the results are sound and can be used to make credible, risk-based
  decisions. This includes determining whether contracted security assessment services
  have sufficient independence, for example, when information system owners are not
  directly involved in contracting processes or cannot unduly influence the impartiality
  of assessors conducting assessments. In special situations, for example, when organizations
  that own the information systems are small or organizational structures require
  that assessments are conducted by individuals that are in the developmental, operational,
  or management chain of system owners, independence in assessment processes can be
  achieved by ensuring that assessment results are carefully reviewed and analyzed
  by independent teams of experts to validate the completeness, accuracy, integrity,
  and reliability of the results. Organizations recognize that assessments performed
  for purposes other than direct support to authorization decisions are, when performed
  by assessors with sufficient independence, more likely to be useable for such decisions,
  thereby reducing the need to repeat assessments.'

supplemental-guidance: Establishing separate baseline configurations for development,
  testing, and operational environments helps protect information systems from unplanned/unexpected
  events related to development and testing activities. Separate baseline configurations
  allow organizations to apply the configuration management that is most appropriate
  for each type of configuration. For example, management of operational configurations
  typically emphasizes the need for stability, while management of development/test
  configurations requires greater flexibility. Configurations in the test environment
  mirror the configurations in the operational environment to the extent practicable
  so that the results of the testing are representative of the proposed changes to
  the operational systems. This control enhancement requires separate configurations
  but not necessarily separate physical environments.

description: The organization analyzes changes to the information system in a separate
  test environment before implementation in an operational environment, looking for
  security impacts due to flaws, weaknesses, incompatibility, or intentional malice.
family: CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT
supplemental-guidance: Separate test environment in this context means an environment
  that is physically or logically isolated and distinct from the operational environment.
  The separation is sufficient to ensure that activities in the test environment do
  not impact activities in the operational environment, and information in the operational
  environment is not inadvertently transmitted to the test environment. Separate environments
  can be achieved by physical or logical means. If physically separate test environments
  are not used, organizations determine the strength of mechanism required when implementing
  logical separation (e.g., separation achieved through virtual machines).

description: 'The information system implements [Assignment: organization-defined
  out-of-band authentication] under [Assignment: organization-defined conditions].'
family: IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION
supplemental-guidance: Out-of-band authentication (OOBA) refers to the use of two
  separate communication paths to identify and authenticate users or devices to an
  information system. The first path (i.e., the in-band path), is used to identify
  and authenticate users or devices, and generally is the path through which information
  flows. The second path (i.e., the out-of-band path) is used to independently verify
  the authentication and/or requested action. For example, a user authenticates via
  a notebook computer to a remote server to which the user desires access, and requests
  some action of the server via that communication path. Subsequently, the server
  contacts the user via the user�s cell phone to verify that the requested action
  originated from the user. The user may either confirm the intended action to an
  individual on the telephone or provide an authentication code via the telephone.
  This type of authentication can be employed by organizations to mitigate actual
  or suspected man-in the-middle attacks. The conditions for activation can include,
  for example, suspicious activities, new threat indicators or elevated threat levels,
  or the impact level or classification level of information in requested transactions.

family: IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION
supplemental-guidance: This control enhancement extends the requirement for organizations
  to change default authenticators upon information system installation, by requiring
  developers and/or installers to provide unique authenticators or change default
  authenticators for system components prior to delivery and/or installation. However,
  it typically does not apply to the developers of commercial off-the-shelve information
  technology products. Requirements for unique authenticators can be included in acquisition
  documents prepared by organizations when procuring information systems or system

- DYNAMIC CREDENTIAL ASSOCIATION
short-title: IA-5 (10)
description: The information system dynamically provisions identities.
family: IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION
supplemental-guidance: Authentication requires some form of binding between an identity
  and the authenticator used to confirm the identity. In conventional approaches,
  this binding is established by pre-provisioning both the identity and the authenticator
  to the information system. For example, the binding between a username (i.e., identity)
  and a password (i.e., authenticator) is accomplished by provisioning the identity
  and authenticator as a pair in the information system. New authentication techniques
  allow the binding between the identity and the authenticator to be implemented outside
  an information system. For example, with smartcard credentials, the identity and
  the authenticator are bound together on the card. Using these credentials, information
  systems can authenticate identities that have not been pre-provisioned, dynamically
  provisioning the identity after authentication. In these situations, organizations
  can anticipate the dynamic provisioning of identities. Preestablished trust relationships
  and mechanisms with appropriate authorities to validate identities and related credentials
  are essential.

family: IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION
supplemental-guidance: Unlike password-based authentication which provides exact matches
  of user-input passwords to stored passwords, biometric authentication does not provide
  such exact matches. Depending upon the type of biometric and the type of collection
  mechanism, there is likely to be some divergence from the presented biometric and
  stored biometric which serves as the basis of comparison. There will likely be both
  false positives and false negatives when making such comparisons. The rate at which
  the false accept and false reject rates are equal is known as the crossover rate.
  Biometric quality requirements include, for example, acceptable crossover rates,
  as that essentially reflects the accuracy of the biometric.

  information system components] at [Assignment: organization-defined time intervals].'
family: MAINTENANCE
supplemental-guidance: Preventive maintenance includes proactive care and servicing
  of organizational information systems components for the purpose of maintaining
  equipment and facilities in satisfactory operating condition. Such maintenance provides
  for the systematic inspection, tests, measurements, adjustments, parts replacement,
  detection, and correction of incipient failures either before they occur or before
  they develop into major defects. The primary goal of preventive maintenance is to
  avoid/mitigate the consequences of equipment failures. Preventive maintenance is
  designed to preserve and restore equipment reliability by replacing worn components
  before they actually fail. Methods of determining what preventive (or other) failure
  management policies to apply include, for example, original equipment manufacturer
  (OEM) recommendations, statistical failure records, requirements of codes, legislation,
  or regulations within a jurisdiction, expert opinion, maintenance that has already
  been conducted on similar equipment, or measured values and performance indications.

description: 'The organization performs predictive maintenance on [Assignment: organization-defined
  information system components] at [Assignment: organization-defined time intervals].'
family: MAINTENANCE
supplemental-guidance: Predictive maintenance, or condition-based maintenance, attempts
  to evaluate the condition of equipment by performing periodic or continuous (online)
  equipment condition monitoring. The goal of predictive maintenance is to perform
  maintenance at a scheduled point in time when the maintenance activity is most cost-effective
  and before the equipment loses performance within a threshold. The predictive component
  of predictive maintenance stems from the goal of predicting the future trend of
  the equipment's condition. This approach uses principles of statistical process
  control to determine at what point in the future maintenance activities will be
  appropriate. Most predictive maintenance inspections are performed while equipment
  is in service, thereby minimizing disruption of normal system operations. Predictive
  maintenance can result in substantial cost savings and higher system reliability.
  Predictive maintenance tends to include measurement of the item. To evaluate equipment
  condition, predictive maintenance utilizes nondestructive testing technologies such
  as infrared, acoustic (partial discharge and airborne ultrasonic), corona detection,
  vibration analysis, sound level measurements, oil analysis, and other specific online
  tests.

family: MEDIA PROTECTION
supplemental-guidance: This control enhancement applies to digital media containing
  classified information and Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI). Portable storage
  devices can be the source of malicious code insertions into organizational information
  systems. Many of these devices are obtained from unknown and potentially untrustworthy
  sources and may contain malicious code that can be readily transferred to information
  systems through USB ports or other entry portals. While scanning such storage devices
  is always recommended, sanitization provides additional assurance that the devices
  are free of malicious code to include code capable of initiating zero-day attacks.
  Organizations consider nondestructive sanitization of portable storage devices when
  such devices are first purchased from the manufacturer or vendor prior to initial
  use or when organizations lose a positive chain of custody for the devices.

  conduct the task. Individuals sanitizing information system media possess sufficient
  skills/expertise to determine if the proposed sanitization reflects applicable federal/organizational
  standards, policies, and procedures. Dual authorization also helps to ensure that
  sanitization occurs as intended, both protecting against errors and false claims

description: >-
  The organization designs its security architecture using a defense-in-depth approach
  that:

  (a) Allocates [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards] to [Assignment:
  organization-defined locations and architectural layers]; and

  (b) Ensures that the allocated security safeguards operate in a coordinated and
  mutually reinforcing manner.
family: PLANNING
supplemental-guidance: Organizations strategically allocate security safeguards (procedural,
  technical, or both) in the security architecture so that adversaries have to overcome
  multiple safeguards to achieve their objective. Requiring adversaries to defeat
  multiple mechanisms makes it more difficult to successfully attack critical information
  resources (i.e., increases adversary work factor) and also increases the likelihood
  of detection. The coordination of allocated safeguards is essential to ensure that
  an attack that involves one safeguard does not create adverse unintended consequences
  (e.g., lockout, cascading alarms) by interfering with another safeguard. Placement
  of security safeguards is a key activity. Greater asset criticality or information
  value merits additional layering. Thus, an organization may choose to place anti-virus
  software at organizational boundary layers, email/web servers, notebook computers,
  and workstations to maximize the number of related safeguards adversaries must penetrate
  before compromising the information and information systems.

family: PLANNING
supplemental-guidance: Different information technology products have different strengths
  and weaknesses. Providing a broad spectrum of products complements the individual
  offerings. For example, vendors offering malicious code protection typically update
  their products at different times, often developing solutions for known viruses,
  Trojans, or worms according to their priorities and development schedules. By having
  different products at different locations (e.g., server, boundary, desktop) there
  is an increased likelihood that at least one will detect the malicious code.

supplemental-guidance: The identification of functions, ports, protocols, and services
  early in the system development life cycle (e.g., during the initial requirements
  definition and design phases) allows organizations to influence the design of the

  identification of functions, ports, protocols, and services avoids costly retrofitting
  of security controls after the information system, system component, or information
  system service has been implemented. SA-9 describes requirements for external information
  system services with organizations identifying which functions, ports, protocols,

description: 'The organization establishes, documents, and maintains trust relationships
  with external service providers based on [Assignment: organization-defined security
  requirements, properties, factors, or conditions defining acceptable trust relationships].'
family: SYSTEM AND SERVICES ACQUISITION
supplemental-guidance: The degree of confidence that the risk from using external
  services is at an acceptable level depends on the trust that organizations place
  in the external providers, individually or in combination. Trust relationships can
  help organization to gain increased levels of confidence that participating service
  providers are providing adequate protection for the services rendered. Such relationships
  can be complicated due to the number of potential entities participating in the
  consumer-provider interactions, subordinate relationships and levels of trust, and
  the types of interactions between the parties. In some cases, the degree of trust
  is based on the amount of direct control organizations are able to exert on external
  service providers with regard to employment of security controls necessary for the
  protection of the service/information and the evidence brought forth as to the effectiveness
  of those controls. The level of control is typically established by the terms and
  conditions of the contracts or service-level agreements and can range from extensive
  control (e.g., negotiating contracts or agreements that specify security requirements
  for the providers) to very limited control (e.g., using contracts or service-level
  agreements to obtain commodity services such as commercial telecommunications services).
  In other cases, levels of trust are based on factors that convince organizations
  that required security controls have been employed and that determinations of control
  effectiveness exist. For example, separately authorized external information system
  services provided to organizations through well-established business relationships
  may provide degrees of trust in such services within the tolerable risk range of
  the organizations using the services. External service providers may also outsource
  selected services to other external entities, making the trust relationship more
  difficult and complicated to manage. Depending on the nature of the services, organizations
  may find it very difficult to place significant trust in external providers. This
  is not due to any inherent untrustworthiness on the part of providers, but to the
  intrinsic level of risk in the services.

supplemental-guidance: As organizations increasingly use external service providers,
  the possibility exists that the interests of the service providers may diverge from
  organizational interests. In such situations, simply having the correct technical,
  procedural, or operational safeguards in place may not be sufficient if the service
  providers that implement and control those safeguards are not operating in a manner
  consistent with the interests of the consuming organizations. Possible actions that
  organizations might take to address such concerns include, for example, requiring
  background checks for selected service provider personnel, examining ownership records,
  employing only trustworthy service providers (i.e., providers with which organizations
  have had positive experiences), and conducting periodic/unscheduled visits to service
  provider facilities.

  processing, storage or services. The criteria external providers use for the selection

  criteria. For example, organizations may want to ensure that data/information storage
  locations are restricted to certain locations to facilitate incident response activities
  (e.g., forensic analyses, after-the-fact investigations) in case of information
  security breaches/compromises. Such incident response activities may be adversely
  affected by the governing laws or protocols in the locations where processing and

family: SYSTEM AND SERVICES ACQUISITION
supplemental-guidance: Static code analysis provides a technology and methodology
  for security reviews. Such analysis can be used to identify security vulnerabilities
  and enforce security coding practices. Static code analysis is most effective when
  used early in the development process, when each code change can be automatically
  scanned for potential weaknesses. Static analysis can provide clear remediation
  guidance along with defects to enable developers to fix such defects. Evidence of
  correct implementation of static analysis can include, for example, aggregate defect
  density for critical defect types, evidence that defects were inspected by developers
  or security professionals, and evidence that defects were fixed. An excessively
  high density of ignored findings (commonly referred to as ignored or false positives)
  indicates a potential problem with the analysis process or tool. In such cases,
  organizations weigh the validity of the evidence against evidence from other sources.

  using all available information technology product and/or information system documentation
  (e.g., product/system design specifications, source code, and administrator/operator
  manuals) and working under specific constraints, attempt to circumvent implemented
  security features of information technology products and information systems. Penetration
  testing can include, for example, white, gray, or black box testing with analyses
  performed by skilled security professionals simulating adversary actions. The objective
  of penetration testing is to uncover potential vulnerabilities in information technology
  products and information systems resulting from implementation errors, configuration
  faults, or other operational deployment weaknesses or deficiencies. Penetration
  tests can be performed in conjunction with automated and manual code reviews to
  provide greater levels of analysis than would ordinarily be possible.

family: SYSTEM AND SERVICES ACQUISITION
supplemental-guidance: Dynamic code analysis provides run-time verification of software
  programs, using tools capable of monitoring programs for memory corruption, user
  privilege issues, and other potential security problems. Dynamic code analysis employs
  run-time tools to help to ensure that security functionality performs in the manner
  in which it was designed. A specialized type of dynamic analysis, known as fuzz
  testing, induces program failures by deliberately introducing malformed or random
  data into software programs. Fuzz testing strategies derive from the intended use
  of applications and the functional and design specifications for the applications.
  To understand the scope of dynamic code analysis and hence the assurance provided,
  organizations may also consider conducting code coverage analysis (checking the
  degree to which the code has been tested using metrics such as percent of subroutines
  tested or percent of program statements called during execution of the test suite)
  and/or concordance analysis (checking for words that are out of place in software
  code such as non-English language words or derogatory terms).

  safeguards; (ii) promote transparency into their organizational processes and security
  practices; (iii) provide additional vetting of the processes and security practices
  of subordinate suppliers, critical information system components, and services;
  (iv) restrict purchases from specific suppliers or countries; and (v) provide contract
  language regarding the prohibition of tainted or counterfeit components. In addition,
  organizations consider minimizing the time between purchase decisions and required
  delivery to limit opportunities for adversaries to corrupt information system components

supplemental-guidance: Organizations use quality metrics to establish minimum acceptable
  levels of information system quality. Metrics may include quality gates which are
  collections of completion criteria or sufficiency standards representing the satisfactory
  execution of particular phases of the system development project. A quality gate,
  for example, may require the elimination of all compiler warnings or an explicit
  determination that the warnings have no impact on the effectiveness of required
  security capabilities. During the execution phases of development projects, quality
  gates provide clear, unambiguous indications of progress. Other metrics apply to
  the entire development project. These metrics can include defining the severity
  thresholds of vulnerabilities, for example, requiring no known vulnerabilities in
  the delivered information system with a Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  severity of Medium or High.

  the principle of least privilege, employing layered defenses, applying the principle
  of least functionality (i.e., restricting ports, protocols, functions, and services),
  deprecating unsafe functions, and eliminating application programming interfaces
  (APIs) that are vulnerable to cyber attacks.

  and firmware in terms of exceptions, error messages, and effects;

  (b) Show via proof to the extent feasible with additional informal demonstration
  as necessary, that the formal top-level specification is consistent with the formal
  policy model;

  (c) Show via informal demonstration, that the formal top-level specification completely
  covers the interfaces to security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware;

  (d) Show that the formal top-level specification is an accurate description of the

  (e) Describe the security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware mechanisms not

supplemental-guidance: Correspondence is an important part of the assurance gained
  through modeling. It demonstrates that the implementation is an accurate transformation
  of the model, and that any additional code or implementation details present have
  no impact on the behaviors or policies being modeled. Formal methods can be used
  to show that the high-level security properties are satisfied by the formal information
  system description, and that the formal system description is correctly implemented
  by a description of some lower level, for example a hardware description. Consistency
  between the formal top-level specification and the formal policy models is generally
  not amenable to being fully proven. Therefore, a combination of formal/informal
  methods may be needed to show such consistency. Consistency between the formal top-level
  specification and the implementation may require the use of an informal demonstration
  due to limitations in the applicability of formal methods to prove that the specification
  accurately reflects the implementation. Hardware, software, and firmware mechanisms
  strictly internal to security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware include,
  for example, mapping registers and direct memory input/output.

  secure the services of external providers who through contractual relationships,
  provide ongoing support for the designated unsupported components. Such contractual
  relationships can include, for example, Open Source Software value-added vendors.

description: The organization minimizes the number of nonsecurity functions included
  within the isolation boundary containing security functions.
family: SYSTEM AND COMMUNICATIONS PROTECTION
supplemental-guidance: In those instances where it is not feasible to achieve strict
  isolation of nonsecurity functions from security functions, it is necessary to take
  actions to minimize the nonsecurity-relevant functions within the security function
  boundary. Nonsecurity functions contained within the isolation boundary are considered
  security-relevant because errors or maliciousness in such software, by virtue of
  being within the boundary, can impact the security functions of organizational information
  systems. The design objective is that the specific portions of information systems
  providing information security are of minimal size/complexity. Minimizing the number
  of nonsecurity functions in the security-relevant components of information systems
  allows designers and implementers to focus only on those functions which are necessary
  to provide the desired security capability (typically access enforcement). By minimizing
  nonsecurity functions within the isolation boundaries, the amount of code that must
  be trusted to enforce security policies is reduced, thus contributing to understandability.

  are important with respect to modularity in software design. Coupling refers to
  the dependencies that one module has on other modules. Cohesion refers to the relationship
  between the different functions within a particular module. Good software engineering
  practices rely on modular decomposition, layering, and minimization to reduce and
  manage complexity, thus producing software modules that are highly cohesive and
  loosely coupled.

description: The information system, in conjunction with a remote device, prevents
  the device from simultaneously establishing non-remote connections with the system
  and communicating via some other connection to resources in external networks.
family: SYSTEM AND COMMUNICATIONS PROTECTION
supplemental-guidance: This control enhancement is implemented within remote devices
  (e.g., notebook computers) through configuration settings to disable split tunneling
  in those devices, and by preventing those configuration settings from being readily
  configurable by users. This control enhancement is implemented within the information
  system by the detection of split tunneling (or of configuration settings that allow
  split tunneling) in the remote device, and by prohibiting the connection if the
  remote device is using split tunneling. Split tunneling might be desirable by remote
  users to communicate with local information system resources such as printers/file
  servers. However, split tunneling would in effect allow unauthorized external connections,
  making the system more vulnerable to attack and to exfiltration of organizational
  information. The use of VPNs for remote connections, when adequately provisioned
  with appropriate security controls, may provide the organization with sufficient
  assurance that it can effectively treat such connections as non-remote connections
  from the confidentiality and integrity perspective. VPNs thus provide a means for
  allowing non-remote communications paths from remote devices. The use of an adequately
  provisioned VPN does not eliminate the need for preventing split tunneling.

supplemental-guidance: External networks are networks outside of organizational control.
  A proxy server is a server (i.e., information system or application) that acts as
  an intermediary for clients requesting information system resources (e.g., files,
  connections, web pages, or services) from other organizational servers. Client requests
  established through an initial connection to the proxy server are evaluated to manage
  complexity and to provide additional protection by limiting direct connectivity.
  Web content filtering devices are one of the most common proxy servers providing
  access to the Internet. Proxy servers support logging individual Transmission Control
  Protocol (TCP) sessions and blocking specific Uniform Resource Locators (URLs),
  domain names, and Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Web proxies can be configured
  with organization-defined lists of authorized and unauthorized websites.

description: 'The information system provides the capability to dynamically isolate/segregate
  [Assignment: organization-defined information system components] from other components
  of the system.'
family: SYSTEM AND COMMUNICATIONS PROTECTION
supplemental-guidance: The capability to dynamically isolate or segregate certain
  internal components of organizational information systems is useful when it is necessary
  to partition or separate certain components of dubious origin from those components
  possessing greater trustworthiness. Component isolation reduces the attack surface
  of organizational information systems. Isolation of selected information system
  components is also a means of limiting the damage from successful cyber attacks
  when those attacks occur.

description: 'The organization employs boundary protection mechanisms to separate
  [Assignment: organization-defined information system components] supporting [Assignment:
  organization-defined missions and/or business functions].'
family: SYSTEM AND COMMUNICATIONS PROTECTION
supplemental-guidance: Organizations can isolate information system components performing
  different missions and/or business functions. Such isolation limits unauthorized
  information flows among system components and also provides the opportunity to deploy
  greater levels of protection for selected components. Separating system components
  with boundary protection mechanisms provides the capability for increased protection
  of individual components and to more effectively control information flows between
  those components. This type of enhanced protection limits the potential harm from
  cyber attacks and errors. The degree of separation provided varies depending upon
  the mechanisms chosen. Boundary protection mechanisms include, for example, routers,
  gateways, and firewalls separating system components into physically separate networks
  or subnetworks, cross-domain devices separating subnetworks, virtualization techniques,
  and encrypting information flows among system components using distinct encryption
  keys.

  information. This control enhancement prevents the exploitation of message externals
  and applies to both internal and external networks or links that may be visible
  to individuals who are not authorized users. Header/routing information is sometimes
  transmitted unencrypted because the information is not properly identified by organizations
  as having significant value or because encrypting the information can result in
  lower network performance and/or higher costs. Alternative physical safeguards include,
  for example, protected distribution systems.

  periods, amount, and predictability. Changes to communications patterns can reveal
  information having intelligence value especially when combined with other available
  information related to missions/business functions supported by organizational information
  systems. This control enhancement prevents the derivation of intelligence based
  on communications patterns and applies to both internal and external networks or
  links that may be visible to individuals who are not authorized users. Encrypting
  the links and transmitting in continuous, fixed/random patterns prevents the derivation
  of intelligence from the system communications patterns. Alternative physical safeguards
  include, for example, protected distribution systems.

supplemental-guidance: Selection of cryptographic mechanisms is based on the need
  to protect the confidentiality and integrity of organizational information. The
  strength of mechanism is commensurate with the security category and/or classification
  of the information. This control enhancement applies to significant concentrations
  of digital media in organizational areas designated for media storage and also to
  limited quantities of media generally associated with information system components
  in operational environments (e.g., portable storage devices, mobile devices). Organizations
  have the flexibility to either encrypt all information on storage devices (i.e.,
  full disk encryption) or encrypt specific data structures (e.g., files, records,
  or fields). Organizations employing cryptographic mechanisms to protect information
  at rest also consider cryptographic key management solutions.

  work factor for adversaries in order to carry out successful cyber attacks. Changing
  virtual operating systems or applications, as opposed to changing actual operating
  systems/applications, provide virtual changes that impede attacker success while
  reducing configuration management efforts. In addition, virtualization techniques
  can assist organizations in isolating untrustworthy software and/or software of

family: SYSTEM AND COMMUNICATIONS PROTECTION
supplemental-guidance: Randomness introduces increased levels of uncertainty for adversaries
  regarding the actions organizations take in defending against cyber attacks. Such
  actions may impede the ability of adversaries to correctly target information resources
  of organizations supporting critical missions/business functions. Uncertainty may
  also cause adversaries to hesitate before initiating or continuing attacks. Misdirection
  techniques involving randomness include, for example, performing certain routine
  actions at different times of day, employing different information technologies
  (e.g., browsers, search engines), using different suppliers, and rotating roles
  and responsibilities of organizational personnel.

description: 'The organization changes the location of [Assignment: organization-defined

family: SYSTEM AND COMMUNICATIONS PROTECTION
supplemental-guidance: Adversaries target critical organizational missions/business
  functions and the information resources supporting those missions and functions
  while at the same time, trying to minimize exposure of their existence and tradecraft.
  The static, homogeneous, and deterministic nature of organizational information
  systems targeted by adversaries, make such systems more susceptible to cyber attacks
  with less adversary cost and effort to be successful. Changing organizational processing
  and storage locations (sometimes referred to as moving target defense) addresses
  the advanced persistent threat (APT) using techniques such as virtualization, distributed
  processing, and replication. This enables organizations to relocate the information
  resources (i.e., processing and/or storage) supporting critical missions and business
  functions. Changing locations of processing activities and/or storage sites introduces
  uncertainty into the targeting activities by adversaries. This uncertainty increases
  the work factor of adversaries making compromises or breaches to organizational
  information systems much more difficult and time-consuming, and increases the chances
  that adversaries may inadvertently disclose aspects of tradecraft while attempting
  to locate critical organizational resources.

family: SYSTEM AND COMMUNICATIONS PROTECTION
supplemental-guidance: This control enhancement misleads potential adversaries regarding
  the nature and extent of security safeguards deployed by organizations. As a result,
  adversaries may employ incorrect (and as a result ineffective) attack techniques.
  One way of misleading adversaries is for organizations to place misleading information
  regarding the specific security controls deployed in external information systems
  that are known to be accessed or targeted by adversaries. Another technique is the
  use of deception nets (e.g., honeynets, virtualized environments) that mimic actual
  aspects of organizational information systems but use, for example, out-of-date
  software configurations.

family: SYSTEM AND INFORMATION INTEGRITY
supplemental-guidance: Indicators of compromise (IOC) are forensic artifacts from
  intrusions that are identified on organizational information systems (at the host
  or network level). IOCs provide organizations with valuable information on objects
  or information systems that have been compromised. IOCs for the discovery of compromised
  hosts can include for example, the creation of registry key values. IOCs for network
  traffic include, for example, Universal Resource Locator (URL) or protocol elements
  that indicate malware command and control servers. The rapid distribution and adoption
  of IOCs can improve information security by reducing the time that information systems
  and organizations are vulnerable to the same exploit or attack.

description: The organization accounts for timing interactions among information system

family: SYSTEM AND INFORMATION INTEGRITY
supplemental-guidance: In addressing invalid information system inputs received across
  protocol interfaces, timing interactions become relevant, where one protocol needs
  to consider the impact of the error response on other protocols within the protocol
  stack. For example, 802.11 standard wireless network protocols do not interact well
  with Transmission Control Protocols (TCP) when packets are dropped (which could
  be due to invalid packet input). TCP assumes packet losses are due to congestion,
  while packets lost over 802.11 links are typically dropped due to collisions or
  noise on the link. If TCP makes a congestion response, it takes precisely the wrong
  action in response to a collision event. Adversaries may be able to use apparently
  acceptable individual behaviors of the protocols in concert to achieve adverse effects
  through suitable construction of invalid input.

  The organization, if information system component failures are detected:

  (a) Ensures that the standby components are successfully and transparently installed
  within [Assignment: organization-defined time period]; and

  (b) [Selection (one or more): activates [Assignment: organization-defined alarm];
  automatically shuts down the information system].
family: SYSTEM AND INFORMATION INTEGRITY
supplemental-guidance: Automatic or manual transfer of components from standby to
  active mode can occur, for example, upon detection of component failures.
